questions:
  - question: Can I request appointments on your website, or do I need to call?
    answer: You can schedule an appointment via [this link](https://dental4.me/integrativedentistry) for a time thatâ€™s most convenient for you, or give us a call at 206-367-6453. Many people prefer to schedule appointments online since it lets you choose what works for you at your own leisure and our site allows you to see all of our available appointments!
    
  - question: Should I arrive early for my first appointment?
    answer: If you have not filled out your new patient paperwork online, please arrive 15 minutes early to your appointment so we can have you fill them out in the office. Otherwise, no more than 5 minutes early to your appointment should be enough.
    
  - question: Should I bring anything to my appointment?
    answer: If you have any insurance that you would like us to courtesy bill for your reimbursement, please bring your dental card with you. Also have handy any past x-rays or information that may help during your initial appointment if you have not sent it via email already.
    
  - question: How long will my appointment be?
    answer: Your initial exam with the doctor will be about an hour and a half, and if you have a cleaning scheduled with that, that would be about another hour of your time.

  - question: Does your office accept insurance?
    answer: We are out-of-network with all insurances, but we do bill insurances that accept claims from non-contracted dentists so we can get you reimbursed by them.
    
  - question: Are you in-network with my insurance?
    answer: Since we are not contracted with any insurance, we would be out-of-network with all plans. This does change the structure of how they reimburse sometimes. For more information, we suggest calling your insurance directly to determine what your benefits would look like ahead of time.

  - question: Does your office see children?
    answer: While we are not a pediatric dentist, we do happily see children. While we especially want to provide care for your family in one location, some children, however, need a little extra something that pediatric dentists are best suited to provide, since their offices tend to look a little more inviting to the younglings. Our goal is to make sure that everyone loves going to the dentist, so if we feel your child would otherwise benefit from another dentist, we may recommend that to you.
    
  - question: What are your office hours of operation?
    answer: We are open Monday through Thursday from 7 AM to 4 PM. To see our current availability, [book online with us](dental4.me/integrativedentistry) or call us at 206-367-6453.
    
  - question: What is your process of removing amalgam/mercury/silver fillings safely?
    answer: All of our providers use the [SMART protocol](https://iaomt.org/resources/safe-removal-amalgam-fillings/). When your doctor first treatment plans your amalgam removal, they will recommend getting in contact with your naturopath to formulate a detoxification plan.
