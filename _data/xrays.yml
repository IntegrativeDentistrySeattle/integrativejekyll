- question: What is your office policy on taking new x-rays? Do I have to do new x-rays on my first exam? Can I use x-rays taken from my previous office?
  answer: In general, we don’t want to take x-rays when they are not necessary. We’d prefer to not subject patients to needless radiation. If you have x-rays from a previous dental office, you can request to have them sent to our email - <info@integrativedentistry.com>. We actually prefer them! In the event that the doctor needs to diagnose something that they see, or can’t see, they may request we take new x-rays at your appointment. Take heart in that our x-ray machines are all digital, and that means a considerably less amount of radiation than older machines. In fact, there’s more radiation involved in your daily activities, such as eating, going outdoors, or even breathing, than a single x-ray in our office.
