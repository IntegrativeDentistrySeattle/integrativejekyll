- question: How often should I change my toothbrush / toothbrush head?
  answer: It is recommended that you change your toothbrush or electric toothbrush head every 3 months. Research shows that new toothbrushes remove more plaque than a worn out one. Over time, your brush also can become more prone to bacterial or fungal growth.

- question: I am a sugar addict, and trying to stay away from sugar is a difficult task. Are there any foods that can help me stop the craving or substitute my sugar intake?
  answer: "There are two agents that are capable of tricking the set-point system: <br> 
- A few tablespoons of UNFLAVORED oil (such as extra light olive oil) swallowed a few times a day between meals gives the body some calories, but doesn’t trip the signal to stop up on more.<br>
- Several ounces of sugar water (granulated fructose) produces the same effect. Sweetness does not seem to act as a flavor in the body’s caloric signaling system.<br>
The result is being far less hungry. This regimen seems to satisfy a set of requirements that many commercial diets do not."
