- question: What material does your office use for cavity fillings?
  answer: Our office uses composite materials to fill cavities. The material is BPA free. We use some of the most popular brands in holistic dentistry, including Gradio SO, Admira Fusion, and Empress.
  
- question: Does your office remove amalgam/mercury/metal/silver fillings?
  answer: We do! And the only cost to you is the replacement filling or crown.

- question: How does your office remove amalgam fillings?
  answer: All of our providers use the [SMART protocol](https://iaomt.org/resources/safe-removal-amalgam-fillings/) to safely remove these fillings. When your doctor first treatment plans your amalgam removal, they will recommend getting in contact with your naturopath to formulate a detoxification plan.

- question: I was recommended to have a root canal or an extraction. What services can you offer to help me save my tooth?
  answer: We can definitely recommend time and supportive measures available within our toolkits to help prolong needing any of these procedures for a few weeks and re-evaluate your need for them afterwards. If there is any pain or swelling, that also factors into what can be done. The first step is an exam to evaluate what options are available to you.
  
- question: I’m looking for a dentist or oral surgeon that can remove a root canal. Does your office provide this service? I have heard root canals are bad. I have a couple and am concerned. What do you do about them? Some of the dentists here say they do root canals with bioceramic materials. Is that good?
  answer: If a root canal treated tooth becomes infected, or no longer viable, we can extract the tooth in our office. We do feel that most of the time, root canals are not the best option for some people. The alternative is to extract the tooth, and either place an implant or bridge.
  
- question: Does your office perform extractions, implants, and implant crowns?
  answer: We do! After an evaluation with one of our doctors, we can determine your candidacy for implants, and we can most of the time perform the whole process within our office. From the date of your extraction, there is typically about a 6 month healing time before the implant, and another 6 months until it has integrated fully so that you are ready for the crown. Time can vary per person, of course. We use zirconia implants in our office, which can be a great alternative to root canal therapy. Our crowns are also metal-free!
  
- question: Does your office do crowns and bridges? What about CEREC, or same day crowns?
  answer: Our doctors do place crowns and bridges, and our office is CEREC ready as well. They are all ceramic, metal-free crowns. Check with your doctor to see what is a right fit for you.

- question: At what age would you recommend a Myobrace for children, if necessary? What services do you offer for Myobrace?
  answer: We evaluate the airway and breathing of all patients, regardless of age, with special attention to the preventative options like Myobrace. If the fit is right, Myobrace can be a great early option for compliant children to form better habits, and potentially avoid much costlier orthodontia later on in life.

- question: Does your office perform lip or tongue tie releases, also known as frenectomies?
  answer: Yes, if it is determined that you or your child need to have a lip or tongue tie release, we can perform the procedure in our office.

- question: Does your office see and treat children?
  answer: While we are not a pedodontist, our office does try to keep care for your family in one place. If you have any children that you would also like to establish within our office, we would be more than happy to see them! Our goal, however, is to make sure that your child’s dental experience is a pleasant one, and while we always strive to make sure that is the case in our office, pedodontic offices tend to be more suitably equipped for children.

- question: At what age should I start taking my child to see the dentist?
  answer: We recommend that children see a dentist as early as 6 months, and no later than one year - the typical time that baby teeth start coming in, and the health of the teeth can be examined.
  
- question: I’m experiencing TMJ/TMD issues. My jaw pops, clicks, and/or moves to the side a bit when I open my mouth fully. Sometimes, I cannot open my mouth as far as would be considered “normal”. Do you see and treat people with these problems?
  answer: We can evaluate the condition. As far as treatment for TMJ, we typically refer to Dr. Jason Pehling, a TMD specialist.

- question: I have constant bad breath, but I brush my teeth regularly. What can I do to help this embarrassing problem?
  answer: We highly recommend you make an appointment to come in to evaluate this with your doctor. Bad breath tends to be the symptom of an underlying problem and would require professional care. The source of the problem could only be determined by a doctor, and they will come up with the proper care to help alleviate the problem.
  
- question: I am looking to have a teeth cleaning that also features use of “air flow therapy/air slurry polishing”. Do you offer this service?
  answer: We are happy to announce that we do have an air polishing machine in our office! Request it when scheduling your first cleaning and we can make sure we schedule you appropriately.

- question: I think or I’ve been told I have periodontal gum disease. Is there anything I can do to treat this naturally at home?
  answer: Gum disease is a serious issue, and unfortunately even with the best at home care and hygiene regimen, it cannot be treated without a professional’s attention, as they have the tools to go under the gumline and clean out the bacteria that progresses the disease. Patients with periodontal disease should see their doctor and hygienist at least 3 to 4 times a year to maintain their oral health.

- question: I’m looking to get my teeth straightened. Do you offer anything in your office for orthodontic care?
  answer: Our office does offer Invisalign to patients. Invisalign is a clear, metal-free alternative to braces that can help you achieve the smile you’ve been waiting for. Schedule a consultation with one of our doctors today to see if Invisalign is right for you!

- question: Does your office test saliva to determine what bacteria are in my mouth?
  answer: We do! It’s called an Oral DNA test. If your oral biome is extremely active, and difficult to manage, we can send in a sample to determine what bacteria may be present and how to best manage it.
