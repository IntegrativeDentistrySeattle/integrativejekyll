- question: What are the costs of the services you offer?
  answer: A comprehensive examination is $285. This appointment is typically an hour and a half, and any x-rays that are needed during this exam are taken at no additional charge to you.<br>Cleanings start at $175, and are usually about an hour. Patients with gingivitis or periodontal disease can expect a higher cost if a deeper cleaning is needed. Your hygienist will inform you after they evaluate you on your first visit with them. For treatment, costs can vary depending on what is needed. Your doctor, their assistant, and our treatment coordinator will work together to give you a treatment plan that is curated specifically to what you need.

- question: I was diagnosed with quite a bit of dental work by another office. I wanted to get a second opinion and see about holistic options. Could I get a quote from your office on what I need done?
  answer: Absolutely! You can send us a copy of your treatment plan to <info@integrativedentistry.com>, or give us the codes they gave you over the phone and we can tell you the cost of the equivalent in our office. Bear in mind that unless we see you for an exam first, we cannot say that the quoted costs are final, as we have not evaluated you ourselves yet.
