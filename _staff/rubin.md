One of the early members of the International Academy of Oral Medicine and Toxicology (IAOMT), he has served in various offices and on its Board of Directors for several years, helping to see it grow into one of the world’s leading authoritative bodies in the area of mercury and other toxins in dentistry. Dr. Rubin was honored as a Fellow of the IAOMT in 1992, and a Master of the IAOMT in 2007. Dr. Rubin is also a charter member of the International Association of Mercury Free Dentists.

With a special interest in the environmental effects of dental amalgam mercury, Dr. Rubin has lectured across the country and published research on this subject. His was the first office in Washington State (and one of the first in the country) to install a mercury capturing system to prevent waste amalgam-mercury from leaving the dental office waste stream, over a fifteen ago.

In 1997, Dr. Rubin was honored as Runner-Up for the Governor’s Award for Pollution Prevention, and won the Puget Sound Waste Information Network’s Award for Environmental Achievement.
