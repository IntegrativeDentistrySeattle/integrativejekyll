At Integrative Dentistry, we intertwine conventional modern dentistry with natural and biological concepts. We provide a different kind of approach to your oral health, looking at the mouth and body as one entity to help you make safe, informed decisions in relation to your entire body. For our practice in Seattle, natural dentistry extends beyond conventional oral health care; we provide alternative strategies as well to improve your overall wellnessâ€“your body, your spirit, and your smile.

For more than 30 years, our doctors have extensively researched and practiced dentistry with a biological emphasis. Biological dentistry recognizes the links between oral health and general health and appreciates that any oral issues or materials placed in the mouth can have lasting effects on other systems in the body. As biological dentists, we work with like-minded healthcare professionals to analyze material compatibility, provide nutritional support, and identify systemic detoxification steps to help remove toxins from the body.

Biological dentistry is about performing dentistry in concert with the biological system. More and more, patients want to know that the materials being used in their treatment are not only high-quality, but also safe. At Integrative Dentistry, we can assure you they are. Through compatibility testing, we have the ability to gain information on material sensitivities a patient may have and go to great lengths to avoid the toxic effect of foreign materials. Obviously, we have not placed any mercury fillings or used fluoride in our practice (since 1987). In addition, we have created a highly effective protocol for safely removing mercury (amalgam) fillings.

As the foundation of our practice is built around a natural approach, we offer supportive alternative therapies in conjunction with the routine dental treatments we offer. In addition to the controversial mercury issue, we also address issues such as posture, opening the airway, TMJ function, sleep apnea, cranial balance, the possible effects of past dental work, issues relating to root canals and past teeth extractions, and effects of poor diet, sleep, and lifestyle. Nutrition counseling, detoxification, herbal medicine, acupuncture, massage, and homeopathy all play integral roles in our practice philosophy.

At Integrative Dentistry, we offer healing natural dentistry in Seattle for your body and your spirit. We invite you to take a step in the right direction. Contact our practice today to request your personal consultation
