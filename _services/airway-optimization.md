Central to life and health<sup>1</sup>, _breathing_ can empower your greatest moments or impede them. You might be surprised that as much as half our population is affected by sleep-disordered breathing<sup>2-4</sup>, and the bigger surprise: many people who suffer some form of sleep-disordered breathing are completely unaware of it<sup>5,6</sup>. This variety of problems, including sleep apnea, hypopnea, and more, presents a myriad of symptoms including [tooth decay](../mercury-free-dentist-seattle-fillings/), daytime fatigue, snoring, [TMJ pain](../tmj-seattle-treatment/)<sup>7</sup> or tooth grinding, [tooth movements](../orthodontics-seattle/), bed-wetting, and a multitude of other comorbidities<sup>8</sup> including heart disease<sup>9</sup>, metabolic disorder<sup>10</sup> and [cancer](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VmUcCmeT9Ld8BtYT0lCf7rpY6XmgXZND/view?usp=sharing)<sup>11</sup>. We spend immeasurable resources treating these<sup>12-15</sup>. However, if we could find and treat the underlying cause, it would be literally life-changing.

Our dental team is trained to recognize the subtle signs of airway problems, work with you to diagnose any disorders, and create a personalized plan to manage or treat breathing problems that works for you.
 
In a word, we __guide you to your optimal breathing state__. And the results can be life-saving.


<blockquote class="p-3 service-blockquote">Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) affects millions of Americans and is estimated to be as prevalent as asthma and diabetes. Given the fact that obesity is a major risk factor for OSA, and given the current global rise in obesity, the prevalence of OSA will increase in the future. Individuals with sleep apnea are often unaware of their sleep disorder. It is usually first recognized as a problem by family members who witness the apneic episodes or is suspected by their primary care doctor because of the individual's risk factors and symptoms. <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The vast majority remain undiagnosed and untreated</span>, despite the fact that this serious disorder can have significant consequences<sup>5</sup>.</blockquote>
