Laser therapy **relieves pain**, enhances circulation, reduces inflammation, boosts immune activity, and **accelerates natural regenerative healing** via the gentle application of visible and infrared light energy to diseased and damaged areas of the mouth. Laser energy **eliminates oral infections** caused by the biofilm bacteria found in gum disease and dental cavities.


Noninvasive therapeutic lasers will reverse gum infections, halt gum disease, and provide safe, immediate relief from tooth sensitivity, post-surgery pain, nerve pain, canker sores, cold sores, and TMJ pain by stimulating your body’s innate cellular and biochemical healing mechanisms without side effects or the use of pharmaceutical interventions.


In a word, **we use light energy to boost natural healing and disrupt biofilms**. And the results are amazing.


> In view of the growing problem of bacterial resistance to conventional antimicrobials, the use of an alternative bactericidal approach to which bacteria are not likely to develop resistance would be valuable. The current treatment for dental plaque-related diseases in the oral cavity involves, first, the mechanical removal of all accessible contamination, and, second, the use of topical and/or systemic antimicrobial medications. Laser therapy may be a suitable antimicrobial approach that can overcome biofilm and antimicrobial-related resistance. <sup>3</sup>
