Dental implants are the single most effective way to preserve foundational bone in the jaw and restore the function and beauty of your smile. We use state-of-the art technology: pure zirconia implants, which offer a highly biocompatible, metal-free solution that combines excellent function with optimal, natural-looking esthetics. These all-ceramic implants form lasting attachments to both bone and soft tissue when placed with [Swiss Surgical Techniques](../swiss-surgical-technique) and will keep you smiling (and chewing) for a lifetime. 

Implantation is a two-part process: first, implants are carefully placed to optimize bone healing, then, after the implant integrates with your bone and gums, a permanent tooth replacement is attached.   

In short, we replace teeth with __implants that work for and with your body__. And the results are synergistic and sustainable. 


<blockquote class="p-3 service-blockquote">Whether it is just one tooth being replaced or several implants recreating a firm set of teeth—the material needs to function stably, neutrally and compatibly over a period of decades. The high-performance ceramic zirconia, long used in orthopaedics for artificial hip joints, fulfills these requirements like no other material<sup>(32)</sup>. Zirconia ceramic is a white, metal-free, immunologically neutral and biocompatible material, which offers many advantages over metal<sup>(33)</sup>. Whether it is an intolerance to titanium or general uneasiness about the prospect of having metal in your body that prompts the use of a metal-free solution— the esthetically-pleasing white ceramic implants made of the biocompatible, high-performance material zirconia are always an excellent choice and according to current studies are classified as equivalent to titanium implants<sup>(34–49)</sup>.<sup>1</sup></blockquote>
