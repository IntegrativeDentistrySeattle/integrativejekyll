Dentistry is one of the rare medical professions that places foreign materials into the body and expects it to be accepted and sustained. The reality is, many people have sensitivities known and unknown to materials and chemicals. At Integrative Dentistry we are very cognisant  about offering the safest treatment for our patients. Material safety is of utmost importance.

In addition to lab testing for biocompatibility, we offer chair side/pre-procedure muscle testing, for accurate and immediate material safety and biocompatibility.  

Ultimately, we offer a unique and individualized reassurance for you and your provider to move forward using dental materials that are the safest available for you!

Muscle testing a practical application of applied kinesiology to get specific “yes” and “no” answers from the body’s first neurological response. An accurate way to test for material safety, chemical safety, material preference, complete removal of decay and infection, treatment sequencing, etc.
