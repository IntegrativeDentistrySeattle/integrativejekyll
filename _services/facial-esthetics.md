Platelet-Rich Fibrin (PRF) is a fully autologous 100% natural blood concentrate obtained via simplified low-speed centrifugation that, among other properties, accelerates wound healing and enhances tissue regeneration. PRF is part of a new holistic facial esthetics protocol that utilizes your body's own natural healing capacity to stimulate collagen regeneration with the ultimate goal of smoothing fine lines and wrinkles for esthetic enhancement. 

On the day of your facial, pure blood drawn from your arm is lightly centrifuged, the liquid growth factors are then injected into your fine lines followed by microneedling to promote the regeneration of collagen for a natural smoothing and lifting facial without any foreign body reaction. 

In a word, we use your own blood components to rejuvenate, heal, smooth and tone aging skin. And the results are phenomenal.

<blockquote class="p-3 service-blockquote">The main advantage of platelet concentrates is that they offer a safe, easy-to-obtain, and completely immune-biocompatible method for the healing or regeneration of aging skin [...] it has become possible to utilize a liquid injectable PRF [...] This formulation has been studied and utilized extensively in various field of medicine and has become increasingly popular in facial esthetics.<sup>1</sup></blockquote>
