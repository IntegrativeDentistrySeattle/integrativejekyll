Cleanings for Sensitive Teeth!

Guided Biofilm Therapy (GBT) is a systematic, predictable solution for dental biofilm management using state of the art AIRFLOW technologies. AIRFLOW is gentle on the tooth enamel, gum tissue and restorative materials.  Air, heated water and low-abrasive powder combine to breakdown and flush away biofilm.  The spray mixture does all the work, and with the fine grain powder, it just feels like warm water is being sprayed on the gums.  AIRFLOW only takes 5 seconds per tooth instead of the 30-60 seconds using traditional methods.  Additionally, using AIRFLOW to remove biofilm will reduce time spent using other instruments removing stains and hard deposits, making your preventative cleaning appointment a more positive experience. 

AIRFLOW therapy can be applied to almost any patient, including those who have dental implants, crowns or veneers, composite fillings, braces or invisalign trays, periodontal disease and pediatric patients.



<blockquote class="p-3 service-blockquote"> GBT minimizes the use of power and hand instrumentation. AIRFLOWÂ® is minimally invasive on all types of dental tissues: dentine, cementum, enamel and gums. Minimal abrasion for maximum comfort: GBT enables the patient to enjoy natural teeth and implants for much longer.<sup>1</sup></blockquote>
