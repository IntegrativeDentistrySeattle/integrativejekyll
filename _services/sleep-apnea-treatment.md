Sleep apnea is a common and disconcerting sleep disorder where the airway closes multiple times during sleep. Airway blockage may be caused by large tonsils, a long soft palate or uvula, excessive fleshy tissues of the throat, or excessive relaxation of the tongue. (As a side note, Dr. Marder now believes that much of this airway reduction is not only structural, but has an inflammatory component. He can speak with you about issues that increase local inflammation, like foods, chemicals, airborne pollutants and pathogens, environmental toxins, etc.) When someone has sleep apnea resulting in obstruction of the airway, they cannot breathe, significantly reducing oxygen levels, disrupting sleep quality, and putting them at risk for a multitude of chronic health issues.

Because of the severity of some of the side effects, Dr. Marder is now recommending an overnight sleep screening for everyone, even children. This involves taking home one of our overnight sleep apnea screening machines (at no cost to you!), where you can sleep in the comfort of your own bed. In the morning, after returning the screening machine to our office, Dr. Marder will evaluate your results to determine whether you have sleep apnea, and if so, what treatment route is best for you.

For many with sleep apnea, oral appliance therapy can be a successful method of treatment. These appliances are prescribed by Dr. Marder, and custom-crafted to hold your lower jaw slightly forward. Your appliance will be worn during sleep to open your airway, allowing proper air flow during sleep to reduce snoring, increase oxygen to the brain and lessen the risk of other symptoms and diseases associated with sleep apnea Seattle.

The benefits of oral appliance therapy for sleep apnea include:

Improved sleep for you and your partner (keeps you off the couch!)
Increased oxygen to the brain
Reduction of snoring
Reduction of TMJ symptoms, reduced head/neck muscle tension
Reduced risk for a multitude of future health problems
Improved day time energy levels so you can live a better life
An overall happier, more well-rested state of being
