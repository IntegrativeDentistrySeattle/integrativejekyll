Myofunctional therapy is an exercise training program to re-teach the oral, facial, and pharyngeal muscles to correctly perform day-to-day functions such as breathing, swallowing, chewing, and speaking. This involves creating a patient specific plan that includes exercises that will help you to create the proper muscle patterns and habits. 


**What are the goals of myofunctional therapy?**
- Establishing nasal breathing
- Optimizing craniofacial growth and development
- Re-patterning chewing and swallowing habits 
- Achieving a palatal tongue resting position
- Eliminating parafunctional habits such as tongue-thrusting 
- Promoting a lip seal


**What are the benefits of myofunctional therapy?**
- May provide relief from orofacial pain, bruxism, and TMD
- May improve speech disorders
- May enhance orthodontic treatment and improve malocclusions
- May improve swallowing/digestive disorders (i.e. headaches, stomachaches, reflux, GERD)
- May improve some oropharyngeal symptoms of sleep disordered breathing


Myofunctional Therapy is a process that takes several weeks, meeting regularly virtually to check on progress and learn new exercises.
