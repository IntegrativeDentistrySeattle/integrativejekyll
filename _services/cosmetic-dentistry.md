The smile is one of your spirit’s most basic expressions. It’s amazing how a smile can empower, enrich, and captivate those around us. However, for someone embarrassed about the condition of their teeth, smiling is often avoided. Among the most gratifying aspects of being a cosmetic dentist in Seattle is in our doctors’ ability to provide bio-compatible solutions which enable our patients to smile freely, and in turn, live a happier, healthier, more enjoyable life.

At Integrative Dentistry, we proudly combine some of the most modern cosmetic treatments, while remaining in concert with our holistic viewpoint, including:

* Conventional veneers
* Teeth Whitening
* Snap-on Smiles

Lumineers are among the greatest advancements in cosmetic dentistry. Lumineers are ultra-thin shells of porcelain, bonded to the front surfaces of teeth and are indistinguishable from your natural teeth. They can be used to hide tooth imperfections such as crowding, chips, cracks, or discoloration, fill in spaces between two teeth, or can be used to create a symmetrical and aligned appearance. Opposed to traditional veneers, Lumineers allow us to transform smiles with the smallest amount of tooth removal as possible. In fact, for some patients, Lumineers may actually be a completely reversible treatment, meaning no tooth removal at all.

Teeth Whitening is a great way to enhance the vitality of your smile and boost your overall spirit, feelings of self-confidence and well-being. At Integrative Dentistry, we offer our patients both a quick in-office whitening treatment, as well as our Nite White and Day White take-home whitening kits. With successful outcomes time and time again, our teeth whitening methods are both safe and effective. We also take extra measures to ensure tooth sensitivity is minimized while protection of the enamel is maximized.

Snap-On Smiles are a revolutionary way to enhance your smile without the time, expense, and commitment of traditional cosmetic treatments. Snap-On Smiles cover virtually any tooth imperfection by doing just as the name implies–snapping right on top of your natural teeth. The teeth fit directly against your gum line to give you an improved, natural-looking smile in an instant. While Snap-On Smiles are a temporary solution, they are a great option for those wanting to enhance their smile for a big upcoming event or those who wish to “test-drive” a smile makeover before committing to anything more permanent.

What’s holding you back from smiling a full, bright smile that expresses your true inner spirit? If you desire a cosmetic dentist in Seattle who uses only bio-compatible materials and a conservative approach, Integrative Dentistry is here to help. We invite you to contact our office today to schedule your cosmetic consultation with our holistic Seattle area dentists.

We are cosmetic dentists in Seattle with a holistic approach.  We offer a wide range of services that include cosmetic dentistry in Seattle for the communities of Bellevue, Shoreline, Kirkland and Bothell, WA.
