Holistic dentistry is all about taking the right steps to collaborate oral health treatments with an overall health plan for optimum systemic health. At Integrative Dentistry, implementing the use of bio-compatible materials for our dental restorations is part of our biological approach. We do Seattle crowns in a natural and holistic way. That’s why we offer CEREC same-day all-porcelain, hybrid porcelain-plastic, and BPA-free onlays and crowns to Seattle area patients seeking a more natural way to restore their smiles.

While very similar, crowns and onlays are two different types of restorations used to repair damaged teeth. Crowns are used to repair a tooth that has been compromised by decay, fracture, or other damage. However, capping a damaged tooth with a crown sometimes unnecessarily removes more tooth structure than is needed. Onlays fall somewhere in between a filling and a crown, and are used when only part of the tooth needs to be restored.

Our CEREC system is a state-of-the-art technology that allows our team to design and fabricate custom crowns and onlays right here in our office. CEREC restorations are milled from a solid block of porcelain or a porcelain-plastic hybrid material, so your new restoration will not only look like natural tooth structure, but will function like it too.

As a biological dental practice, it’s important to us that the materials used in any dentistry placed in your mouth are completely compatible with the rest of your system. Some dental materials can cause problems for people who experience systemic sensitivities and can be the basis for chronic symptoms. Biological dentistry is the pursuit for optimal whole body health using the most biologically compatible materials available. To choose the right materials for your onlay or crown, we will use a compatibility test to minimize any systemic sensitivities, while still providing you maximum strength, durability, and a natural appearance in your restoration crowns Seattle.

We create harmony in your body and your mouth for a lifetime of well-being and healthy smiles by combining natural alternatives with quality dentistry. To find out if onlays or crowns in our Seattle office are right for you, please contact Integrative Dentistry to schedule your consultation with us today.
