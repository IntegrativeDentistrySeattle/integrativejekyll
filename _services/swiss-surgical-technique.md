The human body has amazing healing mechanisms, and by optimizing conditions for them to function, healing from a surgical procedure will be more effective and more comfortable than ever before. Based on the [Swiss BioHealth Concept](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Da72rqh9keXHcOcpX68DS5DDCkxo8N8P/view?usp=sharing)™, our approach to surgery includes quality nutrition and healthy lifestyle pre-procedure, collaboration with your other health providers, and specific procedural steps and materials such as [platelet-rich fibrin](../prf-platelet-rich-fibrin-seattle) application, [ozone therapy](../ozone-therapy), and non-metal [zirconia implants](../zirconia-implants). The goal of any surgery is to place the body in a position where it can heal itself; we take extra steps to ensure the body can do exactly that, facilitating unprecedented healing and further reducing any complications.

From pre-procedure analysis to final healing, our dental team will develop a plan integrating advantageous nutrition and health habits, precise surgical technique, biocompatible materials, and post-surgery directives for favorable healing that will maximize your health sustainability.

In short, we __maximize your body’s native healing potential__ to minimize the impact of surgery on your life. And the results are spectacular.


<blockquote class="p-3 service-blockquote">In very simple terms, the objectives of THE SWISS BIOHEALTH CONCEPT can be defined as partnering with immunology; working in a radical but stress-free (atraumatic) way from an early stage, in a preventive and minimally invasive manner which avoids swelling and pain; reaching the goal in as few sessions as possible to minimize the time the patient is out of action; using as few foreign materials as possible and - if any are required - keeping them as biologically compatible as possible, AND keeping the patient in a parasympathetic state throughout the therapy to the greatest extent possible.<a href="https://www.swissdentalsolutions.com/dokumente/2020_Swiss-Biohealth-Concept-letter-us-web.pdf"><sup>1</sup></a></blockquote>
