Dr. Short specializes in general dentistry with a focus in alternative techniques for reducing and managing dental anxiety. She completed her doctorate and certificate in Public Health at the Arizona School of Dentistry & Oral Health and an Advanced Education in General Dentistry from the Lutheran Medical Center .  Dedicated to providing comprehensive and holistic care to her patients, Dr. Short completed her certification in Wholistic Kinesiology (WK, a holistic practice that uses muscle testing to address all areas of whole body health). She has always strongly pursued whole body wellness and optimization, which brought her to her passion for the emotion element in health and healing, culminating in her expertise as an Advanced Consciousness Kinesiologist.

Dr. Short was raised in a commercial fishing family in Southeast Alaska. After competing in collegiate basketball for the Lower Columbia College Lady Red Devils, she completed her undergraduate studies in general sciences at Western Washington University. After dental school, working for the Indian Health Services in Arizona for four years and two years of extensive travel and work, she was drawn back to the Pacific Northwest. She loves to travel, immerse herself in new cultures, explore worldly and local cuisine, learn new skills, enhance consciousness, attempt outdoors and water adventures/sports, and continue to commercial fish with her family.

Dr. Short strives to ensure an individualized and optimal dental experience to each of her patients by combining her passions of emotion/energy work, muscle testing and whole body health with the dental profession.
