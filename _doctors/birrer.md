*As my patient, you are not just another set of teeth; you are another conversation, another story, another friendship. By knowing who you are, I can know what your teeth mean to you, and this is where dentistry begins.*

### EXPERTISE
+ SMART (Safe Mercury Amalgam Removal Technique) Certified with IAOMT (International Academy of Oral Medicine & Toxicology)
+ Same-day all-ceramic fillings and crowns using CEREC CAD/CAM technology. These restorations are strong, long-lasting, natural-looking without metal, without BPA, without temporaries that break or fall off, and without a 2nd appointment. You will leave my office that day with teeth that are ready to use!

When not restoring smiles, Dr. Birrer enjoys watching independent films and exploring local cuisine with his wife, Katherine.
