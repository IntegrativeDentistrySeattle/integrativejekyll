Dr. Ko graduated with honors from the University of California, Irvine, with degrees in Computer Engineering and Biological Sciences. He then went on to pursue his Doctorate of Dentistry at Tufts University (DMD).  While in dental school he was awarded Excellence in Undergraduate Periodontics from the Northeastern Society of Periodontists.  Dr. Ko practiced in California for three years before moving to Washington where he completed his periodontology training at the University of Washington School of Dentistry (MSD).  He is a current member of the Academy of Periodontology and has completed his formal board certification. When not working in private practice, he enjoys teaching dental students and serves as an affiliate faculty at University of Washington.

Dr. Koâ€™s life outside of dentistry includes participating with his wife and dog in all the great outdoor activities the Pacific Northwest has to offer such as running, kayaking, paddleboarding, and hiking in the numerous trails nearby. When time allows, he loves to travel and experience different cultures and cuisines.
