Dr. Rubin is one of this area’s pioneers in mercury safe dentistry, abandoning the use of mercury amalgam (“silver”) dental fillings in 1980. One of the early members of the International Academy of Oral Medicine and Toxicology (IAOMT), he has served in various offices and on its Board of Directors for several years, helping to see it grow into one of the world’s leading authoritative bodies in the area of mercury and other toxins in dentistry. Dr. Rubin was honored as a Fellow of the IAOMT in 1992, and a Master of the IAOMT in 2007. Dr. Rubin is also a charter member of the International Association of Mercury Free Dentists. In 2009, Dr. Rubin co-founded New Directions Dentistry, a company dedicated to teaching dentists nationwide how to practice mercury safe dentistry.

With a special interest in the environmental effects of dental amalgam mercury, Dr. Rubin has lectured across the country and published research on this subject. His was the first office in Washington State (and one of the first in the country) to install a mercury capturing system to prevent waste amalgam-mercury from leaving the dental office waste stream, over a fifteen ago. As of July of 2003, all King County dental offices are now required to have such equipment. In 1997, Dr. Rubin was honored as Runner-Up for the Governor’s Award for Pollution Prevention, and won the Puget Sound Waste Information Network’s Award for Environmental Achievement. He was the first, and one of the few dental offices to receive Envirostars’ highest 5-star rating. Dr. Rubin has appeared and testified before informational hearings by King County Board of Health and the Washington State Senate Committee on Health and Long Term Care.

_After 46 years of service and advocacy in biological dentistry, Dr. Rubin hangs up his handpiece and loupes to focus on dental education, magic, lucid dreaming, and being a grandfather. We’re proud to announce Dr. Rubin’s retirement and will closely follow his ongoing efforts in [educating the next generation](https://midwifery.bastyr.edu/civicrm/event/info?reset=1&id=3406) of naturopathic doctors!_
