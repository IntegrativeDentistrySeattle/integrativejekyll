A loyal Seattle native, Dr. Murphy graduated from Tufts University School of Dental Medicine in Boston, MA.  He then served 5 years in the Air Force where he completed an Advanced Education in General Dentistry Residency, receiving the highest level of training across all dental specialties. When not devoting himself to the local community, Dr. Murphy is the ultimate family man. His favorite thing to do at home is to relax with his wife, a rare luxury as they have three young children! Here at ID, Dr. Murphy's mission is to educate patients on whole-body health and provide the specialized holistic dental care that sets us apart, always ensuring that the individual needs of each person are met in a mindful, naturopathic way.
