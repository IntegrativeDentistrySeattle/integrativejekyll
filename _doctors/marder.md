Dr. Marder has been working in biomedical dentistry for over 30 years. His philosophy is that each person who entrusts their care to deserves his best. “I hope to treat each individual with compassion and love, taking into account their general health interplay, their personal bio-compatibility, and their desires and values. In every way I can, I hope to identify a cause before treating a symptom. In this way, I hope to touch each person in a meaningful way.”

Dr. Marder is a member of the American Academy of Craniofacial Pain, International Academy of Oral Medicine and Toxicology, Environmental Dental Association, [Holistic Dental Association](www.holisticdental.org), [American Orthodontic Society](www.orthodontics.com), American Academy for Functional Orthodontics, and American Academy of Dental Sleep Medicine. His special interests are in Craniofacial Development (assisting the growing skull and cranium), Treating Sleep Disorders – being aware of the airway (apnea, snoring), Facial Pain – treating TMJ and headache issues, Dental Implants (introducing non-metal implants), and holistic care.
