<p>Halitosis, also known as bad breath, is a common problem that can affect anyone, regardless of their age. One in four people is suffering from bad breath on a regular basis. But what are the causes and how to prevent it?<!--more--></p>
<p><strong>The Cause of Halitosis</strong></p>
<p>This condition can be the result of numerous things, but it is caused by a poor oral hygiene in most cases. If you let the bacteria build up in your mouth, it will eventually cause a bad smell. Bacteria feed on the food pieces in your mouth, breaking them down. During this process, the bacteria release an unpleasant-smelling gas. This happens with any food trapped between your teeth. It will be broken down by bacteria and will cause bad breath. Eating foods which are strongly flavored, such as garlic and onions, can also be the cause of your bad breath. Smoking and drinking can also lead to a smelly breath.</p>
<p>In some cases, bad breath can be a sign of worry. It could indicate a more serious condition known as periodontal disease (gum disease).  This condition is the result of Gingivitis left untreated. The periodontal disease, also known as gum disease affects the gums and the bone that holds the tooth in place. The gums pull away from the tooth leaving the base of the tooth open to bacteria. In time, at the base of the tooth a pocket will form, and debris will build up there, infecting the tooth and the bone.</p>
<p>But, in general, halitosis is the result of poor dental habits. If you don’t brush your teeth regularly and promote the bacterial growth around your gums and between your teeth, this will lead to bad breath.</p>
<p><strong>Preventing and Treating Halitosis</strong></p>
<p>There are many ways in which you can prevent the bad breath. First of all you need to practice a good hygiene. You need to brush at least twice a day with antibacterial toothpaste. Also, by exercising a correct brushing and taking care of every tooth two times a day, you prevent the plaque from creating and accumulating. Don’t forget to brush your tongue and change your toothbrush after three months of usage or after an illness. In addition, it is best if you floss regularly and use mouthwash after each brush.</p>
<p>If you smoke, try to quit and stop drinking and eating foods that are full of sugars. Sugar helps the bacteria to develop faster. It is better to drink a lot of water, to keep your mouth moist, and your body hydrated.</p>
<p>Another thing you can do is to see a dentist on a regular basis. Doctors recommend you to see a dentist at least six months. This will prevent and resolve any small problems ahead of time before the plaque and cavities develop into something harder and more expensive to treat. You can also ask your dentist which products are the best for bad breath and what he recommends for you. It is better to prevent than treat. And remember, twice a day!</p>
