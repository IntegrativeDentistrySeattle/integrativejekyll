<p>You wouldn’t expose yourself to toxic chemicals that would negatively impact your overall health. However, you may be surprised to know your body is constantly exposed to heavy metal toxicity on a daily basis especially mercury.<!--more--></p>
<p>According to Dr. Mercola, the two primary sources of mercury exposure are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Seafood</li>
<li>Amalgam dental fillings</li>
</ul>
<blockquote><p>“The average individual has eight amalgam fillings, from which they could absorb up to 120 micrograms of mercury per day. Adults with four or more amalgams run a significant risk of mercury-related health problems from them, while in children as few as two amalgams will contribute to health problems.”</p></blockquote>
<h2>It’s time to detox</h2>
<p>In <a href="http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2013/01/28/chlorella-for-mercury-poisoning.aspx" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">this article by Dr. Mercola</a>, he talks about the pure health benefits of chlorella and how it can detox your body from mercury exposure.</p>
<p>Chlorella, single-celled fresh water algae, is referred as the “near-perfect” food with outstanding health benefits. It’s effectiveness over detoxing was proven in a study where mice that had exposure to mercury excreted it out of their bodies when given chlorella.</p>
<p>Some of those health benefits include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Repairing nerve tissues</li>
<li>Enhancing your immune system</li>
<li>Improving digestion</li>
<li>Promoting healthy pH levels</li>
<li>Increased energy levels</li>
<li>Normalized blood sugar and blood pressure</li>
<li>Remove toxic metals from your body</li>
</ul>
<p>You can find chlorella products in small tablets (500mg each) and will want to take several times a day:</p>
<blockquote><p>"It's not something that you just take occasionally like some herbs or some supplements. Chlorella is something you want to be taking every day… You need to be getting at least 4 grams each day of chlorella to get the benefits that it provides."</p></blockquote>
<p>Dr. Mercola importantly cautions people to detox their bodies slowly. This process takes time and will cause severe “flare ups” if you “sprint” to detoxification.</p>
