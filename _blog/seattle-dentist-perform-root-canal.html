<h2>What Can You Expect When You are in Need of a Root Canal?</h2>
<p>When it comes time for you to need a root canal, the dentist will first prepare your tooth, so you do not feel any pain. You will be numb, due to the injections of Novocaine you will receive before the procedure is started. You may feel some slight discomfort as you are given the injections, but soon the medication will prevent you from feeling any pain. Once you are completely numb, the dentist will begin the procedure by creating a small opening in the top of your tooth. This opening is important because it will allow your tooth to be completely cleaned out.</p>
<p>The cleaning process involves removing all of the inner tissue of the tooth, including the nerve. Since the nerve is no longer functionally required in adult teeth, removing it will not cause any adverse reactions and will prevent you from feeling any further pain. Once the tooth has been cleared out, the Seattle Dentist will use special canal files to scrape down the inside of the root structures, making sure they are completely clean of any infection or decay.</p>
<p>Once your tooth is clean inside, it will be permanently filled. In some instances, a crown is then applied over the tooth, depending on the damage the tooth has. This helps to further protect the tooth and prevent any damage.
