<p>You may think that the digestive process is simple. You just put the food in your mouth, chew it and swallow it. After that, your body will break down the food into components that can be utilized and absorbed by the body. What’s left gets excreted as waste. But in reality things are not so simple. Digestion is a complex process and it can easily be sidelined by external factors, such as not chewing enough, stomach acid, lacking of enzymes, and an unbalance of the microbes that are in charge with food digestion and nutrient absorption. In this article, you will learn how to clean your diet and help you balance your digestive system with 5 simple foods.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Aloe Vera</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Aloe Vera gel is very rich in enzymes and it is a good antibacterial, antiviral and anti-fungal fighter. It also has powerful anti-inflammatory properties, which makes it perfect for a number of digestive problems. It is excellent against acid reflux.  Aloe vera also has a high amount of an immune-stimulating polysaccharide, which induce the white blood cells to secrete interferon, beneficial cytokines and tumor necrosis factor. Aloe is also helpful for candida infections, constipation, parasitic infections, ulcers, colitis and Crohn’s disease</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong>Kefir and Coconut Kefir</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Fermented milk (kefir) and fermentated coconut water (coconut kefir) are two more options that you can add to your diet. They are both rich in probiotics and enzymes that promote a healthy bacterial balance in your gut. Kefir is simple to make at home using only organic, raw milk or coconut water. In addition, kefir also contains minerals (magnesium), beneficial yeast, calcium, essential amino acids, B1, B2 and B7 vitamins, complete proteins, vitamin k and phosphorus. If you don’t consume dairy, you can try coconut kefir. It is a perfect alternative for it.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong>Red Cabbage</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>It is very rich in amino acid L-glutamine. This is known to help heal any soft tissue lining your intestines. It is much more helpful for those suffering from leaky gut, celiac disease, ulcerative colitis, irritable bowel syndrome and Crohn’s disease. You can consume red cabbage steamed, juiced or fermented.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li><strong>Chlorella</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>This is a single-celled freshwater algae, and it is often referred as a near-perfect food because of it’s wide range of benefits. It promotes a healthy pH level in your gut, thus helping good bacteria to thrive. Chlorella is also a potent detox agent against mercury and other heavy metals. It is also rich in fiber and helps to tone the lining of your intestines, thus keeping you in shape.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li><strong>Chia Seeds</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>These contain about 10g of fiber in only two tablespoons. Chia Seeds are rich in anti-inflammatory phytochemicals that are good for soothing gastrointestinal distress. Because of their mild flavor, they can be added to a large variety of recipes. In addition, they are gluten free and perfect for those with celiac gluten intolerance, celiac disease or those who just simply avoid gluten. You can add chia seeds to any food from raw yogurt to smoothies and applesauce.</p>
<p>Add these foods to your diet and your digestive problems will go away.</p>
