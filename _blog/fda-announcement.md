On September 24th, 2020, after [187 years of use in the U.S.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3010024/#sec1-2title), the FDA finally (partly) acknowledges the health risks of mercury-containing amalgam fillings. The FDA now joins the rest of the worldâ€™s scientific community and health organizations in questioning the use of mercury in dentistry.
