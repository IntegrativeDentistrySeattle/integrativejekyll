<p>Let’s face it; most people have no problem providing the reasons why they avoid the dentist. Common excuses include:</p>
<ol>
<li> Fear—the smells, sensations, etc.</li>
<li>“My teeth don't hurt, so why go?”</li>
<li> “I don't have time.”</li>
<li>“I’d rather spend my money on something else.”<!--more--></li>
</ol>
<p>While your brain may tell you such justifications are adequate, consider what your oral health has to say.</p>
<h2><b>To Go or Not to Go?--That is the Question</b></h2>
<p><strong><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1769" alt="Visit your dentist in Seattle" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/end-year-insurance-6.jpg" width="403" height="403" />“I’m Nervous”</strong>—bad childhood memories, needle phobias, a sensitive gag reflex—these fear-based reservations, though understandable, can generally be overcome. How? Dramatic improvements in both tools and techniques now ensure a gentler approach to dental treatment. Ask about sedation dentistry options like “non-needle” numbing, establishing a “Stop!” signal, etc. By communicating your specific fears beforehand, we can accommodate by adjusting your treatment plan so you still receive the oral health care you need - without the anxiety.</p>
<p><strong>“No Problems,”</strong> No Dentist?—is the only reason to go to the dentist to fix oral health issues already noticeable or painful? No! Why wait until the ship is sinking to patch the hole? Scheduling regular visits is crucial to maintaining a healthy smile and saves you money by preventing more drastic procedures.</p>
<p><strong>“It’s Not a Priority”</strong>—Oral health often takes a backseat to seemingly more important endeavors. Yet, an increasing amount of <a href="http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/dental/DE00001" target="_blank">scientific studies reveal</a> an oral-systemic link between a healthy smile and a healthy body. Brushing, flossing, and regular dental visits are therefore a vital part of living a healthy, productive lifestyle. A vibrant smile and healthy mouth can truly help reduce sick days, medical emergencies, and health related expenses.</p>
<p><strong>“It's Too Expensive”</strong>—Money doesn't grow on trees and most of us do not have unlimited funds. If you do have dental insurance, you just may be missing out on the benefits available to you! Are you taking advantage of the twice yearly dental checkups and cleanings included? For some restorative treatments that are more costly and require multiple phases, balancing the treatment between two calendar years can really pay off. Do you require our assistance  in managing the timing of this? We’re here to help you maximize your benefits!</p>
<p>Putting off necessary dental treatment often results in issues worsening, which then mandates even more extensive or expensive treatment. Here’s a message from mouths united around the world: <i>A little money spent on </i>maintaining<i> a healthy smile saves you a whole lot of time and money in the long run!</i></p>
<p>Use It or expires at the end of the year. It would be wise to use that money up before it's too late. Thankfully, there's still time! If you're unsure about what your coverage includes and how to make the best use of it, we would be happy to help you out and go over your plan with you.</p>
<p>Put the excuses aside and contact your dentist in Seattle today to maximize your benefits—your teeth and gums will thank you with a lifetime of healthy smiles.</p>
