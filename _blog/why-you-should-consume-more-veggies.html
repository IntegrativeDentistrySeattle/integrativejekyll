<p><span>Vegetables are excellent for your body. They are low in calories, contain a lot of vitamins and minerals that are essential for your body, have lots of fibers, and are a nutritional cornerstone. People usually consume some of the vegetables, like lettuce and tomatoes. But there is a large variety of vegetables available for you that you can consume in countless ways and combinations. </span><!--more--></p>
<p><strong><span>Reasons why to consume more vegetables</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Eating raw vegetables, such as salad, will help boost your immunity system and receive essential vitamins and minerals. You can either consume the vegetables as a salad, or you can consume them by juicing them.<img class="alignright  wp-image-2409" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/dr-marder-2-1024x720.jpg" alt="dr marder 2" width="445" height="313" /></span></p>
<p><span>Fermented vegetables are also an alternative of boosting your veggie intake. Fermenting is the best way to turn standard vegetables into superfoods because during this process, beneficial microbes are produced. These bacteria are good for your health, help keep a balanced intestinal flora, and boost your immunity system.  This type of foods are also the best detox agents available, meaning that they will contribute to eliminating certain toxins from your body (including metals and pesticides). </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Realize that processed foods are not good for you</span></strong></p>
<p><span>More and more people are consuming fewer vegetables. Instead, they prefer to eat processed foods, which have more chemicals than vitamins. This is a thing that is supported by the big corporations and markets because the processed foods are cheap to create and don’t need time to grow (just add some raw components and a lot of chemicals and you are done). That is why, if you go to any shop you will see a few vegetables and countless aisles of processed foods at bargain prices. Don’t let this fool you. You choose cheap; you get cheap. </span></p>
<p><strong><span>More reasons why to consume vegetables</span></strong></p>
<p><span>If you are among the majority who skips on their vegetables, you have to know that you are missing out on substantial health benefits, including: </span></p>
<p><span>Healthy flowing skin. Aside from the watery and phytochemical content, veggies help your skin have the healthy, natural “glow”. There are also a lot of vegetables that are known for their anti-aging effects, combating wrinkles and helping firm your skin. </span></p>
<p><span>Weight management. Eating vegetables can help you lose and manage your weight. Just by cutting net carbs and at the same time increasing your fiber intake, you will manage to lose weight faster than by following complicated diets. Fibers also help improve your blood pressure, blood sugar levels, cholesterol levels, and protect your heart from cardiovascular problems.</span></p>
<p><span>Improved gut health. Constipation is a clear sign of bowel problems. More than 1 in 5 Americans suffer from this condition. This can cause painful cramps, bloating and it is really uncomfortable. But vegetables have fibers and have the water necessary to prevent this from happening.</span></p>
<p><span>There a lot of reasons why you should eat more vegetables. The only reason why you should avoid a particular vegetable is if you are allergic to it. But if you are not allergic, you should consume them as much as possible. People have survived so far on vegetables, fruits and from time to time with animal meat. Only in the last 60 years or so the processed food has become more used, but this does not mean it is good for your body. As more and more people have started to suffer from obesity and other health problems that were not so common 100 years ago, it is clear that processed foods are not ideal for your body. </span></p>
