<p>In America, more than 40 million people suffer from diabetes or are pre-diabetics. But the most worrying thing is that one out every two individuals suffering from diabetes doesn’t even know they suffer from this condition. Diabetes is a disease sometimes resulted from poor lifestyle choices, such as having a poor diet and consuming products that have lots of sugars. But the best strategy of controlling and reducing the risk of diabetes is to create a system that will manage the sugar intake. In this article you will learn a couple of tips on how to avoid diabetes and, if you already suffer from it, to manage it.<!--more--></p>
<p><strong><span>Insulin, Ghrelin, and Leptin</span></strong></p>
<p><span>The body is a complex system that combines countless enzymes, hormones, and chemicals. But if you believe that with the help of only one hormone you can keep your health in order, you are mistaken. People always tell that diabetes is the result of too much sugar in your blood. But in fact, diabetes is a consequence of insulin resistance of your cells. Insulin is a hormone that is secreted by your pancreas and is responsible for guiding blood sugars across cell membranes. In the cell, the sugars are used as fuel. But if the cells become resistant to insulin, all the glucose (sugar) will remain in your blood, thus raising your blood sugar levels.<img class="alignright  wp-image-2406" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/dr.-marder-1-1024x682.jpg" alt="Dr. Marder 1" width="442" height="294" /> </span></p>
<p><span>Another function that raises your blood sugars is the leptin signaling. Leptin is the hormone produced by the fat cells. Its function is to tell your brain that your body has stored enough fat and that it needs to burn calories at a normal rate. </span></p>
<p><span>Lastly, the third hormone that is involved with diabetes is the ghrelin. This hormone is secreted in your stomach, and its role is to tell your brain that you are hungry. </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Human body and diabetes</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Long term damages to your body may be triggered from chronic high blood sugars resulted from poor nutrition and the lack of exercise. It is critical to evaluate your dietary choices so that you prevent diabetes. Diabetes is a condition that can affect all your body. Diabetics may also suffer from:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Heart disease </span></li>
<li><span>Stroke </span></li>
<li><span>Heart attack</span></li>
<li><span>Glaucoma</span></li>
<li><span>Retinopathy</span></li>
<li><span>Cataracts</span></li>
<li><span>Bacterial and fungal infections</span></li>
<li><span>Kidney disease </span></li>
<li><span>High blood pressure </span></li>
<li><span>Foot ulcers</span></li>
<li><span>Hearing loss</span></li>
<li><span>Digital sclerosis</span></li>
<li><span>Gingivitis and periodontal disease</span></li>
<li><span>Diabetic neuropathy </span></li>
<li><span>Gastroparesis </span></li>
<li><span>Alzheimer’s disease </span></li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span>Get your fibers on </span></strong></p>
<p><span>One of the most important things you should do</span><span> is to add to your diet lots and lots of fibers. There are two types of fibers: insoluble and soluble.The soluble fibers can absorb the water from your intestinal tracts and slow the process of digestion. This helps you feel fuller and for a longer period. The insoluble fibers will increase the rate of digestion and reduce your risk of suffering from colon cancer.</span><span> This type of fibers also prevents constipation and maintains a specific weight. </span></p>
<p><span>You have to consume both types of fibers if you want to have a healthy body. In America, people eat on average 15 grams of fibers a day. But this is much lower that the limit recommended by the American Heart Association, which is 25-30 grams for each 2,000 calories consumed. Some nutritionists recommend you to consume 50 grams for every 1,000 calories. </span></p>
<p><span>Eating</span><span> more fibers will not put you at risk of anything, they will only make you better. Fibers improve the healthy function of your body and also reduce the possibility of heart disease, bowel movement problems, kidney stones and many others.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Excellent</span></strong><strong><span> fiber sources </span></strong></p>
<p><span>There are a lot of foods that are a perfect source of fibers. These are the best sources of fibers and you can add them to your diet anytime. </span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>China seeds </span></li>
<li><span>Almonds</span></li>
<li><span>Berries</span></li>
<li><span>Cauliflower</span></li>
<li><span>Beans</span></li>
<li><span>Peas</span></li>
<li><span>Root vegetables (onions and sweet potatoes)</span></li>
<li><span>Psyllium seed husk</span></li>
<li><span>Vegetables (Brussel sprouts and broccoli)</span></li>
<li><span>Air popped popcorn</span></li>
<li><span>Flaxseed meal</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>It is also crucial that you reduce the carbohydrates and replace them with healthy fats that will improve your health and promote good cellular function. Avocados, coconut oil, raw organic nuts, grass-fed meat, olives/olive oil, palm oil, and organic butter are some of the best sources of healthy fats you should add to your diet. </span></p>
<p><span>Just by changing your diet a little bit you can improve your health significantly, and you will also avoid suffering from chronic diseases. </span></p>
