<p>If you are afraid to see the dentist, you should consider what can happen to your teeth without proper dental care. Dentists recommend that you have routine dental exams twice a year. These routine exams are important in keeping your teeth, and gum's clean. Did you know that brushing, and flossing alone will not remove all of the plaque from your teeth? In fact, brushing, and flossing will not completely remove all of the food and bacteria from between your teeth, or below the gum lines either.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>During your dental exam, your dentist will professionally clean your teeth. During those cleanings he will be able to remove the plaque from the surface of your teeth, and from below the gum line. This is particularly important since plaque is the leading cause of cavities and gum disease. In addition, plaque can actually harden and become tartar build-up, which is much harder to remove from your teeth. A Dentist in Bellevue Wa can provide you with the cleanings that your teeth desperately need.</p>
<p>Without proper cleanings to remove the plaque, and bacteria, you can develop gum disease. Some of the early signs of gum disease include red, bleeding gum's, and shifting teeth. Should you notice either of those signs, it is important that you seek treatment from a Dentist at Integrative Dentistry in Bellevue, WA. Integrative Dentistry is staffed with caring dentists who will work diligently to protect your teeth. Should you be diagnosed with gum disease your <a href="http://www.mitchmarderdds.com/about-us/holistic-dentist-seattle-marder/" title="Dentist in Bellevue Wa">Dentist in Bellevue Wa</a> will begin aggressive treatment for the disease. Part of that treatment will include a deep cleaning.</p>
<p>During the deep cleaning your dentist will begin by scaling the entire root, which will remove all of the plaque, and tartar. Once the plaque and tartar have been removed, he will plane the surface of your tooth to remove any rough edges that were left by the scaling. The periodontal sac will also be cleaned, in order to remove any bacteria, or debris that might be present. Gum disease that is left untreated can eventually lead to tooth loss, so it is important that you continue routine treatment with your dentist.</p>
