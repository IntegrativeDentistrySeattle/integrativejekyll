<p>It is often unsettling when people stare at your mouth, trying to figure out the color, size and configuration of your braces. This may undoubtedly cause one to become uneasy. Even though braces effectively serve their purpose and have done so for many years, they also draw attention to themselves. This is one major reason why most people who want to straighten their teeth are opting to visit their Dentist for invisalign.<!--more--></p>
<h2>Benefits of Invisalign over Traditional Braces</h2>
<p>Since Invisalign works in more or less the same way as the traditional braces, the only major difference is that it is invisible. This means that you can smile as much as you like without worrying about people staring at your teeth. Besides this, invisalign is uniquely tailored for every patient which guarantees a perfect and comfortable fit. Further, this treatment is suitable for patients of all ages. Given that the aligners are easy to remove and clean, invisalign does not limit your diet in any way.</p>
<p>However, you need to take precautions when consuming sugary snacks and alcohol.</p>
<h2>Cost</h2>
<p>The average cost of getting invisalign from Dentist is about $5000. However, it is important to note that the cost of being treated with this type of aligners is dependent on:</p>
<ul>
<li>The extent of treatment you need</li>
<li>The number of aligners needed</li>
<li>The duration of treatment.</li>
</ul>
<p>Before you decide to undergo this treatment, it is prudent to first get an idea of how the aligners will look on you. One of the responsibilities of a Dentist at Integrative Dentistry is to provide information to patients, as well as giving their insight regarding your dental and oral health. As such, he may be able to show you computer images depicting how the aligners are going to look on you. This way, you are able to get an idea of the number of aligners needed, as well as the costs involved.</p>
