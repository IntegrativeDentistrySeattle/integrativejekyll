<p><span>Well Seattle, the New Year has arrived, and with it, a promise to do better. Maybe you’re pledging to lose weight or eat less sweets, or maybe you’re interested in upping your holistic dentistry routines. Whatever the case, try and choose a resolution that’s attainable and will benefit you not just today, but in the long term. Below are some holistic dentistry New Year’s resolutions you should consider for 2015. </span></p>

<p><strong><span>Balance Your pH Levels<br />
</span></strong><span>Holistic dentistry is based on the idea that your mouth is often a snapshot of your overall well-being. What you put into your body will impact your oral health and vice versa. For example, if you find you’re constantly getting <a href="http://www.mitchmarderdds.com/services/mercury-free-dentist-seattle-fillings/">cavities</a>, it may be the result of excessive acid throughout your system. The holistic dentistry solution is to limit yourself to <a href="http://www.acidalkalinediet.net/alkaline-foods.php">highly alkalinizing foods</a> (such as broccoli, almonds, or watermelon) for a period of several days until your acid level is restored to a healthy amount. </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Replace Mercury Fillings<img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-2197" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/21-300x199.jpg" alt="replace-mercury-fillings-holistic-dentistry" width="300" height="199" /><br />
</span></strong><span>From a holistic dentistry standpoint, mercury is a known neurotoxin. <a href="http://iaomt.org/mercury/">The International Academy of Oral Medicine and Toxicology</a> has demonstrated that every time you chew, drink hot beverages or get work done at your Seattle holistic dentistry clinic, you are actually releasing mercury vapors into your system. Amalgam fillings are actually the number one source of mercury exposure, and over the course of a lifetime, can impact your systemic health. Your Seattle holistic dentistry clinic is experienced in both the <a href="http://www.mitchmarderdds.com/services/seattle-mercury-free-dentist-removal/">safe removal</a> of mercury fillings and the use of <a href="http://www.mitchmarderdds.com/services/mercury-free-dentist-seattle-fillings/">mercury-free fillings</a> for a safer, healthier smile.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Drink More Water<br />
</span></strong><span>You’ve probably heard how drinking eight cups a water a day is essential to your overall health. But did you know it also possess holistic dentistry benefits as well? Oftentimes brushing or flossing your teeth after a meal or treat may be inconvenient, particularly if you are at work or out with friends. This gives acids excessive time to attack your enamel and potentially cause tooth decay. However, rinsing your mouth with water, or simply drinking a glass with your meal or snack, can reduce bacteria by 30%. It’s a free and effective holistic dentistry solution that anyone in Seattle can adopt.  <img class="alignright size-full wp-image-2198" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/31.jpg" alt="obstructive-sleep-apnea-holistic-dentistry" width="460" height="300" /></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Get A Better Night’s Rest<br />
</span></strong><span>Poor sleep can contribute to a <a href="http://www.mitchmarderdds.com/services/sleep-apnea-seattle-treatment/">host of problems</a> – including an inability to concentrate, depression, headaches, weight gain, and more serious medical conditions such as high blood pressure and heart disease. The good news is, there is a holistic dentistry solution to your sleep difficulties. You may be suffering from sleep apnea, a common but serious condition that impacts <a href="http://sleepapnea.org/i-am-a-health-care-professional.html">22 million Americans</a>. Sleep apnea can be caused by a soft palate collapsing at the back of your throat while sleeping, disrupting your sleep as your brain wakes up your body to correct itself. Your Seattle holistic dentistry professional can construct a custom-built mouth guard to keep your airways clear and give you a better night’s rest. <strong></p>
