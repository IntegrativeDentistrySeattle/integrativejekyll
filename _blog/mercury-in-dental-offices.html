<p>Today, there is a new growth area, called Mercury Safe Dentistry. You may be wondering what mercury has to do with dentistry. Did you know that in 2004, around 1008 tons from the 2000 tons of mercury used in commerce were used in amalgam fillings? Each year, 34 tons of mercury are added for the placement of new amalgam fillings. Did you know that ADA estimated that 50% of the mercury that enters the wastewater is from the dental offices? Mercury is the most poisonous, nonradioactive substance on earth, and it can be very toxic in micrograms. It is the only metal that is liquid at a room temperature, and it is colorless, odorless and tasteless. No matter the level of mercury, it is not safe.<!--more--></p>
<p>Mercury is poison to your teeth and your overall health. There is proof that not only amalgam fillings release toxic vapor of mercury, but also the simple act of brushing one amalgam filling releases more mercury than the levels permitted by the governmental regulatory agencies.</p>
<p>Dentists are aware of this, but most people are not. It is crucial that you are, and you fully understand what it means to have amalgam fillings. More than 75% of the people still don’t know that mercury is the main component of amalgam fillings. In addition, 92% of the people surveyed want to be informed about all their options (mercury and non-mercury dental filling material).<img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-2373" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/metal-300x159.jpg" alt="metal" width="300" height="159" /></p>
<p>Having an amalgam filling means putting yourself in danger and those around you as well. Chewing food, brushing your teeth, tooth grinding, dry polishing, unsafe removal and wet polishing are simple simulations that result in a person releasing mercury from the filling.</p>
<p>Now it is clear why people are going to the doctor with chronic mercury poisoning symptoms. Your dentist is obligated to inform you about all methods and substances he or she is using. But if he is not, feel free to ask as many questions as you can until you are satisfied with the procedure. Don’t let yourself get poisoned because you were uninformed.</p>
<p>Today there is still no regulatory and legal requirement to minimize and monitor the mercury vapor levels at the dentist’s office. Dentists have a moral and ethical responsibility to protect you, their staff and environment from the toxic substances that are in the office. More and more people started to opt for mercury safe dentistry, because they became aware of the problem and how dangerous it is to their patients’ health.</p>
<p>Ask your dentist about what fillings they use and what other options you have.  Dentists have started to practice a mercury safe dentistry, but you can not be sure until you ask.</p>
