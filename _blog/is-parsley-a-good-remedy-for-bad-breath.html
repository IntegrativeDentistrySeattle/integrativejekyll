<p>Parsley is a common herb that is cultivated by people for more than 2000 years. Native to the Mediterranean, parsley was used in ancient Greece to make crowns for honored athletes and decorations for the tombs. It is believed that Romans were the first ones who used parsley as a garnish; it is known that it was a popular seasoning during the Middle Ages. Today parsley is used in the US mostly as a garnish, forgetting about the benefits it could offer. This happens because it is believed that parsley can serve as a breath-freshener. But can parsley really cure bad breath?<!--more--></p>
<p><strong>Parsley is a strong antioxidant and disease fighter</strong></p>
<p>Parsley has a unique combination of different volatile oil compounds, including limonene, myristicin, eugenol, and alpha-thujene. In addition, it is also rich in flavonoids like apigenin, apiin, luteolin, and criterion. Both the flavonoids and volatile oils in parsley offer numerous health benefits.<img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-2384" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/dr-marder-2-300x200.jpg" alt="Dr Marder 2" width="300" height="200" /></p>
<p>For instance, myristicin can inhibit a tumor formation and activate glutathione, which is the human body’s most potent antioxidant and keeps all other antioxidants working at peak levels. Apigenin inhibits the formation of breast cancer cells and also shrinks the cancer tumors. Luteolin calms the inflammation in your brain, the primary cause of neurodegeneration. It is also good to lower the age-related memory loss problems.  But parsley is also full of vitamin C, folic acid, beta-carotene and vitamin K.</p>
<p><strong>Parsley vs. Bad breath</strong></p>
<p>Parsley’s “green” grassy taste and bright green color come as a result of high levels of chlorophyll. This is a compound with high deodorizing and antibacterial properties. It is known since 1950 that 100 milligrams of chlorophyll neutralize bad breath and bad odors from perspiration, urine, stools, and menstruation.</p>
<p>Research on parsley is still being conducted on its effectiveness for bad breath. This is because parsley has demonstrated to have deodorization properties, but not over an extended period. While green tea shows to be very effective to reduce bad breath over a longer period, chewing gum, mints and parley-seed oil do not. As even science is not perfect, you can give parsley a try and see if it will help you. You can chew parsley to cover bad breath temporary.</p>
<p><strong>Visit a dentist</strong></p>
<p>The best thing you can do if you suffer from bad breath is to visit a dentist. At a dentist’s office, you can determine what the source of your bad breath is. What if it is generated by an untreated cavity or infection? Do you want to cover the smell and wait until the problem gets worse and maybe painful? Get yourself checked out regularly and practice a good oral hygiene. By doing this two, you will not have to worry about bad breath.</p>
