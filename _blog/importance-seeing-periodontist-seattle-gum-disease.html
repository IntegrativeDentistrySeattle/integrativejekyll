<h2>What Is Periodontal Disease and How Is It Treated?</h2>
<p>Periodontal disease is a disease that affects your gum tissue. It first starts out as a mild form, called gingivitis. Gingivitis makes your gums red and causes some irritation and bleeding when brushing your teeth. When you see these telltale signs, it is time to seek your dentist for help. Seeing your dentist and practicing good oral hygiene habits can help to completely reverse this gum condition and prevent it from developing into periodontal disease, which poses a much greater risk for your dental health.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Periodontal disease causes major damage to your gum tissue. As the disease progresses, it causes pockets to develop around each of your teeth. These pockets fill with infection that your body will seek to destroy. In the battle to overcome the infection, the fragile structures holding your teeth in place are inadvertently attacked. When this happens, you will experience loosening of your teeth and eventual tooth loss, if the condition goes untreated.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
To treat periodontal disease, the <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/services/periodontics-seattle/" title="Periodontist in Seattle">Periodontist in Seattle</a> will need to take aggressive measures to end the infection. This involves cleaning out the pockets through oral surgery and reducing the inflammation and swelling in the gum tissue, often through laser therapy. This condition requires strong antibiotic care, to end the ravaging effects of the disease.<br />
