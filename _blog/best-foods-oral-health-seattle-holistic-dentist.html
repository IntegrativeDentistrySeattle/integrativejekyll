<p><strong><span>The Best Foods for Holistic Oral Health Recommended by your Seattle Dentist</span></strong></p>
<p>There is no denying the importance of brushing and flossing your teeth, as well as regular professional maintenance with your Seattle holistic</p>
<p><span>dentist. However, many people don’t realize that what they eat not only impacts their body’s health, but their oral health too. Below are some of the mouth-friendliest foods, as well as their benefits on your teeth, gums, and overall holistic oral health.</span><!--more--></p>
<p><strong><span>(Most) Crunchy Fruits &amp; Vegetables<br />
</span></strong><span>It should come as no surprise that some of our healthiest foods are also helpful when it comes to oral care. Crunchy fruits and vegetables such as cucumbers, carrots, and apples are called ‘dental detergents’, in part because they increase the flow of saliva – which is critical to fighting off bacteria between teeth brushing sessions. That being said, not all fruits and veggies are created equal. Fruits that are high in acidic content – such as oranges or grapefruit – can be harsh on your tooth enamel; the protective exterior layer of your teeth. Eat these fruits in moderation. </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Dairy Products<img class="alignright size-full wp-image-2181" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/43.jpg" alt="43" width="285" height="285" /><br />
</span></strong><span>As you likely already know, dairy products are rich with calcium, which helps promote bone density throughout your body, including your teeth enamel. If you aren’t a dairy eater, other calcium-rich foods include almonds and leafy greens. Seattle holistic dentists will also recommend dairy products because they can help reduce acid levels in your mouth. Of the dairy products out there, cheese is one of the best for oral health. A <a href="http://www.livescience.com/40569-foods-healthy-teeth-bad-breath.html">study published in the General Dentistry journal</a> noted that teens who ate cheese had a rapid drop in their mouths’ pH levels, leading researchers to believe cheese has the ability to neutralize plaque acids. </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Tea<br />
</span></strong><span>Black and green teas are loaded with polyphenols, a compound that’s been shown to slow down the bacteria which causes gum disease and cavities. Not only that, polyphenols can help combat bad breath (halitosis). Tea also tends to be rich in fluoride, a proven cavity-fighting tooth strengthener. While sipping tea can certainly help, your best bet is to rinse with a bit of tea for one minute at a time, several times a day, to reduce both the amount and stickiness of plaque buildup. Of course, there is one slight concern with consuming that much tea: it can also stain your teeth. If you’re noticing your teeth are starting to dull in color, ask your Seattle holistic dentistry practice about <a href="http://www.mitchmarderdds.com/services/cosmetic-dentist-seattle-cosmetic-dentistry/">teeth whitening</a> options.</span></p>
<p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-2184" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/45-300x199.jpg" alt="45" width="300" height="199" /></p>
<p><strong><span>Nuts<img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-2182" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/44-300x200.jpg" alt="44" width="300" height="200" /><br />
</span></strong><span>Not only are nuts a heart-healthy, protein-rich source of fuel, they’re also beneficial to your teeth. Most nuts contain a range of micronutrients such as phosphorous and potassium which are helpful for oral health. Calcium is one of the main takeaways though – it can help protect your enamel and has been associated with teeth remineralization. Almonds and brazil nuts are amongst the richest in calcium, while <a href="http://www.besthealthmag.ca/get-healthy/oral-health/six-foods-to-improve-your-dental-health?slide=5">cashew</a> nut shell oil has been shown to be an effective agent in fighting off cavity-causing bacteria.</span></p>
<p><strong><span><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-2183" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/57-300x300.jpg" alt="57" width="300" height="300" />Raw Onions<br />
</span></strong><span>To be fair, munching on raw onion can give you pretty terrible bad breath after a meal…but the benefits of doing so may just convince you to give it a try. Raw onions have been proven as one of the most effective bacteria-fighting foods out there, easily wiping out some of the strains that are responsible for gum disease and cavities. Try adding some raw onion to your salad or sandwich for a holistic oral health booster – the other ingredients can help take the bad breath ‘sting’ away. </span></p>
<p><span>These are just some of the foods your <a href="http://www.mitchmarderdds.com/about-us/seattle-holistic-dentist-why-different/">Seattle holistic dentist</a> highly recommends you make a regular part of your diet to promote overall dental health. Speak with your dentist about other options to ensure you’re approaching every part of your oral health from a holistic standpoint. </span></p>
