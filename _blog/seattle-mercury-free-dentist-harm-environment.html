<p>Did you know that one drop of mercury in a lake would poison the lake that the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) would ban fishing in it? Then, why would we put mercury fillings in our mouths?<!--more--></p>
<p>According to Dr. Mercola, “mercury is a <strong>potent heavy metal toxin</strong> that can poison your brain, central nervous system and kidneys.” It may come as a shock, but the average person in the US has eight mercury fillings.</p>
<p>In this <a href="http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2013/07/21/mercury-treaty-update.aspx?e_cid=20130721_SNL_Art_1&amp;utm_source=snl&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=art1&amp;utm_campaign=20130721" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">excellent article</a> from Dr. Mercola, he highlights the importance of knowing the dangers caused by amalgam (mercury) fillings, and how call for urgent action is important and needed.</p>
In fact, efforts are being made to stop dental manufacturers and dentists from using amalgam material.</p>
<p>Dr. Mercola mentions Former Attorney General for West Virginia Charlie Brown recently held a press conference to challenge dental manufacturer DENTSPLY to stop making amalgam in “the interest of human and environmental health.”</p>
<blockquote><p>“They certainly make good dental equipment,” Charlie says. “They make all the other dental materials. They don’t need to sell amalgam – it’s a tiny part of their profits – but they do so anyway. They are ignoring their duty as a good citizen for the environment.”</p></blockquote>
