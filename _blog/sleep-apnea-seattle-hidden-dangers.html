<p>Do any of these scenarios sound familiar?</p>
<ul>
<li>You go to bed early, wake up at a reasonable hour, yet still feel completely un-refreshed and ill-equipped to tackle the commitments of a new day.</li>
<li>Your significant-other, or perhaps family members sleeping nearby, complain regarding your <strong>exuberant snoring</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you can relate to these situations, have you considered you might suffer from <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/services/sleep-apnea-seattle-treatment/ " target="_blank">sleep apnea</a>?<!--more--></p>
<h1><strong>Sleep Apnea Facts</strong></h1>
<p>While not everyone who snores suffers from sleep apnea, according to the <a href="http://www.sleepapnea.org/asaa-blog/sleep-apnea-awareness-day-is-april-18-2013.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">American Sleep Apnea Association</a> (ASAA), some 20 million adults are affected by this condition. Other studies suggest another 10 million Americans suffer from sleep apnea but lack the official diagnosis.</p>
<p>Obstructive sleep apnea is the most widespread form of sleep apnea. This means the flow of vital oxygen into your lungs by way of your mouth and nose is significantly hindered. Breathing can become shallow or even stop during frequent episodes that may last an average of 10 to 20 seconds each.</p>
<p>Such pauses can occur 20 or more times in a single hour, resulting in disrupted sleep that leaves your body fatigued. (By the way, breathing does generally regulate temporarily after the sleeper subconsciously gives a “choking cough” or “loud snort”.)</p>
<h1>Sleep Apnea and Your Health</h1>
<p>Future studies will no doubt shed even greater light on the subject, but there is a number of health risks already linked with obstructive sleep apnea. These include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Heart Disease</li>
<li>Type 2 Diabetes</li>
<li>High Blood Pressure</li>
<li>Memory Loss</li>
<li>Adult Asthma</li>
<li>Weight Gain and Obesity</li>
<li>Increased Likelihood of a Car Accident</li>
<li>Depression</li>
<li>Stroke</li>
</ul>
