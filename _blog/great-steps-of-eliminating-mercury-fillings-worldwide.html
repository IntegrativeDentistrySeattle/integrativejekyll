<p>The dangers of amalgam fillings are gaining nationally and worldwide recognition. In fact, the International Academy of Oral Medicine &amp; Toxicology (IAOMT) sent out a <a href="http://iaomt.org/scientific-dental-academy-aid-u-n-global-phase-down-mercury-fillings/">press release</a> announcing its aid to help the U.N.’s commitment for a global phase-down of mercury fillings.</p>

<p>On January 19, the United Nations Environment Programme’s (UNEP) Intergovernment Negotiating Committee (INC5) and IAOMT “formalized a legally-binding treaty to reduce global use of dental amalgam, a restorative tooth filling material containing 50% mercury.”<!--more--></p>
<p>In this treaty, the IAOMT is creating an educational program to “assist interested nations in facilitating a UN global treaty’s requirement to phase-down use of dental amalgam fillings.” The program will include “six hands-on steps toward ending dental mercury use.”</p>
<p>Many countries are applauding these wonderful organizations for the recognition of the dangers of mercury fillings and the action to eliminate these sources to protect human health and the environment. The UNEP Executive Director, Achim Steiner, states “Mercury, which exists in various forms, remains a major global, regional and national challenge in terms of threats to human health and the environment.”</p>
<p>Countries including Australia and Pakistan support the treaty, and is a great step towards eliminating the use of mercury fillings altogether. At <a href="http://mitchmarderdds.com/">Integrative Dentistry</a>, we are committed to the practice of natural or biological dentistry to ensure quality health for your teeth and well-being.</p>
