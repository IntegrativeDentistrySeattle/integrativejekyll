<p>Did you know your nutrition directly affects your smile’s health? This <a href="http://www.bartonremedies.com/archive/1bpnewsletter/Do-Your-Teeth-Reflect-Your-Health-This-Diet-Sharply-Reduces-Stroke-Risk-5761835.html" target="_blank">article by Amanda Box</a> from Barton Publishing highlights beloved dentist Dr. Price’s mission to create a diet that prevents and treats cavities.</p>
<p>Dr. Price traveled around the world, examining multiple native tribes’ teeth. With his studies, he crafted a nutritional diet that prevented over 95% of cavities—even saw cavities heal themselves!<!--more--></p>
<h2>The Nutritional Diet</h2>
<p>In this <a href="http://www.bartonremedies.com/archive/1bpnewsletter/Do-Your-Teeth-Reflect-Your-Health-This-Diet-Sharply-Reduces-Stroke-Risk-5761835.html" target="_blank">article</a>, Dr. Price had the following recommendations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Eliminate processed foods such as white flour, sugar, and most grains.</li>
<li>Replace hydrogenated oils with healthy ones such as extra virgin coconut oil</li>
<li>Make homemade bone broth filled with minerals and gelatin</li>
<li>Eat fermented foods</li>
<li>Use raw dairy</li>
<li>Increase intake of foods with K2 (cheese, butter, oil, and liver)</li>
<li>Intake adequate amounts of vitamin D</li>
</ul>
<h2>Get the Right Toothpaste</h2>
<p>Dr. Price also noted that  the right toothpaste is crucial for a healthy smile. When you meander down the shopping aisles, be sure to avoid toothpastes with the following ingredients:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fluoride</li>
<li>Glycerin</li>
<li>Sodium lauryl sulfate</li>
<li>Artificial sweeteners</li>
</ul>
<p>These ingredients prevent your teeth from remineralization.</p>
<p>With these natural elements, it only makes sense to see a dentist in Seattle who approaches your oral health from a holistic paradigm. At Integrative Dentistry, Dr. Mitch Marder emphasizes natural dentistry to treat your mouth and body as one complete entity.</p>
