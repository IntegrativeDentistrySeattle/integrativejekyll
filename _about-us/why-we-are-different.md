Here at Integrative Dentistry we invite you to take part in a different kind of dental experience. Here, our Seattle holistic team of dentists practice dentistry from a holistic and naturopathic standpoint, carefully analyzing your system as a whole instead of a collection of different body parts. This means we assess your oral health as a representation of your total health and wellness, as well as the opposite; looking at how your systemic health affects your oral health! Then, we integrate both traditional and alternative treatments to improve your well-being both systemically and orally.


Our unique philosophy is apparent in all aspects of our patient care. We strongly believe in using only the most bio-compatible materials available to minimize your exposure to any toxins that may cause negative systemic problems. We accomplish this by offering metal-free, mercury-free, BPA-free, and fluoride-free alternatives to today’s more traditional dental treatments. As an extra measure, we provide compatibility testing, attempting to identify the safest choice for each person, before placing any materials.


In addition, we take special precautions when removing potentially harmful amalgam fillings, implementing a safe mercury removal protocol to protect our patients. In this way, each person is not exposed to this harmful neurotoxin upon its removal. Our practice has met many patients that became sicker upon mercury removal when no precautionary steps were taken.


We use herbal remedies, homeopathic remedies, medical ozone, infra-red light, and others to stimulate and promote the body’s natural healing process, calm anxiety, alleviate pain, and thus create a non-toxic systemic environment during healing. Another integration is to provide dental care with other medical modalities, such as general medicine, naturopathy, acupuncture, homeopathy, chiropractic care, nutritional counseling. We work to coordinate with your other care providers as necessary in order to improve your treatment results. One of the biggest issues in health care today is the lack of coordination between a patient’s healthcare providers; we aim to bridge that gap. We spend time listening to you – your concerns, preferences, ideas, and questions, and hold that ultimately, you, are in charge of your body and your treatment. Only by fully understanding your personal situation and treatment options, can you choose how to proceed with care, directing us as you believe is best.


At Integrative Dentistry, we provide a natural approach to your oral health and wellness without compromising quality or beauty. If you are looking for a Seattle holistic dentist providing alternative medicine to meet your family’s oral health needs and values, contact Integrative Dentistry to schedule your appointment with us today.
