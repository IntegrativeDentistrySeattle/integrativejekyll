<p>A poor sleep can be a distress call, alerting you about the beginning of Alzheimer’s disease. Sleep problems are common for patients who suffer from Alzheimer’s, but recent studies have concluded that poor sleep can contribute to the disease and driving the amyloid plaque buildup in the brain. The accumulation of amyloid plaque in the brain is a hallmark of the Alzheimer's disease.<!--more--></p>
<p><strong>Don’t disrupt the deep sleep</strong></p>
<p>Disturbing the deep sleep can lead to memory impairment. A researchers group has measured the brain waves of 25 cognitively healthy older adults during their sleep. The results showed that those with a periodic disrupted deep sleep presented higher amounts of amyloid plaques in their brain. Furthermore, people with both disturbed sleep and greater amounts of amyloid plaque scored lower results on memory tests before and after sleep. The study showed that interrupted deep sleep contributes to the amyloid buildup, which is linked to impaired performance.</p>
<p><strong>Sleep loss can damage your brain</strong></p>
<p>A calm and relaxing sleep is necessary for maintaining metabolic homeostasis in your brain. Permanent walking is associated with mitochondrial stress. In addition, without sufficient sleep a neuron degradation is visible, and it could set in as a permanent thing.</p>
<p>Inconsistent and intermittent sleep ( such that one experienced by shift workers) will generate an irreversible and considerable brain damage. You can actually lose 25 percent of the neurons located in the local coeruleus. This is a nucleus in the brainstem that is associated with wakefulness, arousal, and different cognitive processes.</p>
<p><strong>Bad sleep habits raise the risk of Alzheimer’s</strong></p>
<p>There is a sizeable quantity of research that links poor sleep to Alzheimer’s and brain damage. These studies showed that subjects that sleep less were found to have a significant more deficient memory. They had an impaired ability to learn new things, although the level of amyloid plaque in the brain was the same as in the subjects that had regular sleep habits. Chances of Alzheimer's to develop is possible for those with inadequate sleep patterns, as well as those with healthy sleep habits. The results showed that the effects of Alzheimer’s appeared faster in subjects with an inadequate sleep pattern.</p>
<p><strong>How much time should I sleep?</strong></p>
<p>In America, the number of persons who suffer from sleep disturbances is exponentially rising. The sleep disorders are endemic in America, where almost 40 percent of adults are reporting that they are falling asleep unintentionally during the day. What is worse is that around 5 percent of men and women have reported nodding off while driving. This is dangerous not only for them but others too. If you go to bed at 10 PM and you wake up at 7 AM, you say that you slept for 9 hours, but in reality this is much less. You spent at least 20-30 minutes falling asleep, and if you woken up during the night for one or more times, you find yourself that you slept for 7 hours and a half. The recommended time you should be asleep each day is between 6 and 9 hours, but it can differ. Every person is different, and you simply need to sleep for as much as you need for your energy to replenish without artificial stimulation.</p>
