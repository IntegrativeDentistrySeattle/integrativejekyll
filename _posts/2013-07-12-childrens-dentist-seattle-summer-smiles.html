<p>Summer vacation is the most fun time of year for most kids. Maybe it's all about playing video games, staying up late, and snacking on junk food—things most kids love to do. Not to be neglected, however, are some faithful friends you desperately need long after the sun-soaked days of summer are over. Who are they? Your teeth.<!--more--></p>
<h2></h2>
<h2>Taking Time for Oral Health</h2>
<p>Enjoying camping trips and toasting marshmallows with friends is what summer vacation is all about. But crawling into a sleeping bag without the usual teeth brushing and flossing can take its toll on your children's teeth over time.</p>
<p><strong>The new school year is like a clean slate</strong> just waiting to be filled with good memories, and opportunities for growth and adventure. That's why we and leading children's dentist in Seattle, Dr. Marder want to remind you of the importance of booking your professional teeth cleaning and checkup for your children —before the rush on the new school year is upon us.</p>
<p>Our approach to <a href="http://www.mitchmarderdds.com/services/childrens-dentist-seattle/">children's dentistry</a> is different than what you'll find at a pediatric dentist. We will encompass your child's entire well-being because we seek to use safer, natural treatment and understand how it affects your children's body. We will never use fluoride, digital x-rays, or sealants on your children without you knowing about it.</p>
<p><strong>Healthy teeth do more than provide your child with an opportunity to show off their smile for their school photo.</strong> They enable your child to be more confident, allow for easier social development, and help to promote good health. That's a much more appealing alternative than being self-conscious about their grin, coping with the discomfort of cavities, and missing days of school from pain and infection associated with tooth decay.</p>
<p>The good news is that tooth decay and other oral health issues experienced by children are by and large <strong>preventable</strong>. Avoid allowing the hectic routine of summer vacation to become detrimental to your oral health routine. Do your best to help your kids understand the importance of maintaining a healthy smile, and make brushing and flossing fun along the way. As always our dental practice is here to help with any advice that you need.</p>
<p><strong>Embrace the summer months and upcoming school year to the full by keeping your families smiles happy and healthy.</strong> We've created a kid-friendly environment that helps ensure your child's visit to our dental office is a positive one, so book that summer checkup today. We look forward to seeing you soon!</p>
