<p>If you are thirsty, you can try drinking pure water. It is always a safe bet if you are thinking of drinking something simple and healthy. But if you are looking to drink a beverage, to drink it slowly and savor it in the morning or when you are on a break and want to relax, plain water is simply not enough. Lucky for you, there are healthy beverages you can choose from. Although there is no possible substitute for water (the body need a healthy amount of it each day) relaxing and different alternatives are tea and coffee. These are the most consumed beverages in the world.<!--more--></p>
<p><strong>Up to four cups of coffee, each day is still OK</strong></p>
<p>This recommendation is based on an evaluation of many meta-analyses and other studies the link between chronic diseases and coffee, <img class="alignright  wp-image-2309" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/tea-and-coffee.jpg" alt="tea and coffee" width="399" height="264" />including cancer, heart disease, type 2 diabetes, Alzheimer’s, and others. Coffee has a bad reputation because of its caffeine content. What most people don’t know is that it also contains beneficial antioxidants, including hydrocinnamic acid and polyphenols. In the US, coffee is the no.1 source of antioxidant in people's diet.  But you have to be careful of the coffee you get. In the recent years, they started to spray the beans with pesticides. Also, improper roasting is another reason for toxins such as acrylamide to creep in. It is better to buy the more expensive coffee than the cheap one because the later one is surely treated chemically.</p>
<p><strong>Coffee is good for the heart and also for the brain. </strong>By drinking coffee every day you decrease the risk of suffering a heart stroke by 65 percent. Also, coffee makes you more alert and focused. In addition, it boosts cognitive performance and protects the neurons from glutamate neurotoxicity.</p>
<p><strong>You can drink a sea of tea</strong></p>
<p>Coffee is not the only beverage that is rich in antioxidants. Tea is neck on neck with coffee. Coffee is the preferred beverage of the Americans, but worldwide tea is number one. It is rich in natural antioxidants. These have a significant effect on the immune system and also help fight against a large number of illnesses and conditions. Black tea is a rich source of tannins and also give a lot of energy that is released throughout the whole day. Black Tea is an excellent alternative to coffee. Tea is also good for the brain, in particular against Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease. In addition, tea helps those who want to lose weight. There is clear evidence that those who drink green tea every day, on a long term, they burn fat much faster.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it is best if you cut the sugar levels as much as possible. Sugar is bad for your teeth and also for the rest of your body. Countless problems have the roots in sugar, such as heart disease and diabetes.</p>
<p>Drink tea and coffee. Take care of your body with this simple choice.</p>
