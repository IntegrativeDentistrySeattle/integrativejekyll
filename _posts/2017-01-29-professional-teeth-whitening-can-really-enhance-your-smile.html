<p><strong>What is professional teeth whitening?</strong></p>
<p>Professional teeth whitening, also referred as in-office whitening, has become the most requested procedure in modern cosmetic dentistry. More than 100 million Americans whiten their teeth one way or another and the estimated annual spending on whitening in the U.S. amounts for nearly $15 billion.</p>
<p>Although there are many options for teeth whitening at home, professional whitening in a dental office is the most preferred whitening method, because even though stronger agents are applied, the rest of the mouth, including the gums, is protected from these materials. The best whitening systems feature a buffer in the gel that protects the tooth enamel from damage. In addition, they are extremely effective and can brighten your smile in a single office visit.  With professional whitening, your teeth can brighten up to 10 shades in about an hour.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Why do you need teeth whitening?</strong></p>
<p>Even if you were born with nice and white teeth, with age your teeth can become darker due to changes in the mineral structure of the teeth. Many factors influence the color of your teeth. Agents, like tobacco, tea, coffee, red wine, as well as foods, containing strong color pigments can cause your teeth to become stained. Certain antibacterial medications, as well as mouth rinses and washes containing chlorhexidine could also stain your teeth.</p>
<p><strong>What are the whitening options?</strong></p>
<p>There are many options to whiten your teeth, which can include one or more of the following:</p>
<p>ü  Avoiding agents that cause stains</p>
<p>ü  Using proper tooth brushing and flossing techniques</p>
<p>ü  Using over-the-counter and in-home whitening agents</p>
<p>ü  Professional teeth whitening in a dental office</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>What are the benefits of professional teeth whitening?</strong></p>
<p>The main reason why in-office teeth whitening is a better choice than using over-the-counter whitening products, is that professional treatments use medical-grade bleaching agents and are performed in a controlled environment. This allows us to accomplish a much brighter, whiter result, while doing no harm to your teeth or gums. Professional teeth whitening would give you best results in shortest time and with minimal risk of tooth or gum damage.</p>
<p>If you are considering teeth whitening and you live or work in Seattle, WA, you can consult one of the top dental specialist in the region, Dr. Mitch Marder from Integrative Dentistry.  Dr. Marder would offer you a thorough examination and help you chose the best solution for your needs.<strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Professional teeth whitening among celebrities</strong></p>
<p>Most of the celebrities that we tend to admire for their perfect smiles have enhanced their appearance with professional teeth whitening and still do on a regular basis to maintain flawless looks. Here are just few examples: <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2478" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/you-can-enhance-your-smile-with-professional-teeth-whitening-from-integrative-dentistry-2.png" alt="You can enhance your smile with professional teeth whitening from Integrative Dentistry 2" width="605" height="177" /></p>
