<p>The third most prevalent condition in the world is the migraine, which affects around 38 million people in the US and more than 1 billion around the world. The majority of sufferers are still in their most productive years, between 30 and 55 years old. Migraines are quite dangerous and may have a significant financial impact on your community and family. The primary characteristic of migraines is the debilitating and severe pain the head. But migraines are more than just a severe headache, as they can cause neurological disorders. Other migraine symptoms are nausea, dizziness, visual disturbances, numbness in the face and extremities, sensitivity to light, smell, sound, and touch. No primary cause has been identified yet, but scientists have discovered a link between the oral bacteria and migraines.</p>
<p><strong>Oral bacteria can predict your migraines</strong></p>
<p>The American Society for Microbiology has recently published a study that shows that people who have migraines have more oral bacteria that reduces nitrates into nitrites. Afterward, the body turn nitrites into nitric oxide. The researchers have linked the increased amount of this oxide with the higher chances of suffering of migraines.</p>
<p>Furthermore, a research where people received drugs to reduce the nitric oxide production showed that if the oxide production lowered, the headaches were alleviated. Scientists are now trying to determine how nitrates can trigger migraines, but the investigation that addresses the oral microbiome is continuing.</p>
<p><strong>Hormones may also be at fault</strong></p>
<p>Hormonal involvement in the way our body functions is no wonder to anyone. Hormones can modify the way we feel, think, and act. The University of Cincinnati revealed a study which showed that people who have migraines are more likely to suffer from thyroid disorders. Scientists also found that women are more prone to suffer from headaches, due to estrogen. Women who have migraines have a 10% drop in their estrogen levels than women who don’t. The reduction of estrogen can also increase the women’s vulnerability to stress, food choices, and lack of sleep.</p>
<p><strong>Migraines</strong> <strong>and vitamin deficiencies</strong></p>
<p>People who have migraines have below averages levels of CoQ10 (coenzyme Q10) and riboflavin. People with episodic migraines have more CoQ10 and riboflavin than those with chronic migraines.</p>
<p>The studies show that if you take CoQ10 supplements, you are less likely to have frequent migraines.</p>
<p><strong>Magnesium deficiency and migraine treatments</strong></p>
<p>CoQ10 is not the only vitamin and mineral deficiencies linked to migraines. In 2012 a paper was published where researchers acknowledged the relationship between magnesium and proper bodily processes. If your body lacks magnesium, you may suffer some illnesses, including platelet aggression, depression, and others. The scientists have formulated a theory where migraines may develop as a result of magnesium deficiency. You could try taking a series of supplements to see if vitamin deficiency is the source of your migraines.</p>
<p>A good way to ease migraines is to turn down the blue light, eliminate processed foods, reduce the foods that trigger your migraines, use essential oils, reduce stress, go to sleep earlier (9-10PM), sleep more (7-9 hours), and use relaxation techniques to reduce the pain.</p>
<p>Don’t let migraine lead your life. Go to the doctor and find out what is causing them.</p>
