<p>Dr. Daisy Sutherland hosts a website called <a href="http://drmommyonline.com/holistic-health-tips-20-say-no-to-white" target="_blank">Dr. Mommy</a> where she provides holistic health tips for her readers, and she has provided one health tip we found beneficial for you and your dental health.</p>
<h2>Holistic Tip: Choose Colorful Foods</h2>
<p>Incorporating colorful foods will add a nutritious value to your lifestyle. They contain natural ingredients such as vitamins and minerals to boost your performance and improve your overall health.</p>
<p>However, it’s important to stay away from the “white” foods. Some of those foods include</p>
<ul>
<li>Bread</li>
<li>Potatoes</li>
<li>Crackers</li>
<li>Rice</li>
<li>Pasta</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, this does not mean you should cut out these foods altogether. When you meander through the grocery aisle, choose whole wheat and grains.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Choosing whole grain varieties will   the same time.”</p></blockquote>
<h2>Healthy Eating Promotes Healthy Smiles</h2>
<p>Not only will natural foods maintain a well-balanced, nutritious lifestyle, it will also promote a healthier smile. Natural foods will cleanse your smile from bacteria and plaque, protecting your smile from harm.</p>
