<p><strong>The different types of tooth decay and dental pain</strong></p>
<p>Acid erosion will weaken the teeth, and that will leave them unprotected properly by saliva. The worst is that people who suffer from eating disorders usually eat more sugary foods and drinks during an attack of compulsive eating. One of the bad habits is drinking fizzy beverages and sweet things in order to make themselves vomit. This way tooth decay will be rapidly increased.<!--more--></p>
<p>Without the enamel, teeth become more sensible to cold, sugar, acid and even brushing.Â  Without the enamel, the dentin, which is more yellow than the enamel, stains easily when in contact with food and this will affect the smile.</p>
<p>Around the age of 28-32 years old, this wearing down effect of the teeth is visible. As a result, you will face great challenges even when eating. Your teeth can even start to crack, and this is an extremely painful process.</p>
<p><strong>The advice you should follow<img class="alignright size-full wp-image-2276" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/bulimia-and-anorexia1.jpg" alt="bulimia and anorexia" width="286" height="176" /></strong></p>
<p>You can stop the damage done to your teeth in just a few simple steps. When you are battling with an eating disorder one of the best things you can do is rinse your mouth after vomit with tap water. Also, you need to wait at least 20 minutes after vomiting until you brush your teeth. You can also use this advice when eating acidic foods or having carbonated drinks.</p>
<p>The correct way of brushing should be done vertical, from the gums towards the end of the teeth. This way you can be sure the bristles of the toothbrush reach between the teeth. You should use a non-abrasive toothpaste and a flexible toothbrush. You can even try different treatments that are especially anti-erosion.</p>
<p>Ninety percent of the people who suffer from eating disorders are also smoking, drinking or drug addicts. All these bad habits will only worsen your condition and will further affect your teeth. As a result you can be suffering from teeth staining, reduced saliva production, acid erosion and even general poor health. A good way of stimulating saliva and limit the acid reflux is to chew sugar-free gum from time to time.</p>
<p>People who suffer from eating disorders usually encounter a deep shame and avoid dentist appointments. The dentist is the only one who can help you and your teeth if you start to suffer from the effects of anorexia or bulimia. The dentist can help you better understand where you are in relation to your teeth and what the next steps should be. He will also give you a list of products that will better suit your needs and help you preserve the healthy part of your teeth. Today there are countless ways of preventing and even restoring tooth decay, like the use of restorative materials. The first step is the hardest, but once you take it is possible to achieve a perfect dental restorative result.</p>
