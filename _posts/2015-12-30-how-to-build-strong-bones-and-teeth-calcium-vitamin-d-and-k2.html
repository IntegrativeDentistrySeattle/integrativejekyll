<p>One of the best strategies for healthy bones and teeth is to consume the right kind of foods. If your diet consists mostly of processed foods that produce biochemical substances, then your body will decrease your bone and teeth density. It is important to avoid processed foods as much as possible.</p>
<p>If you eat high-quality, biodynamic, organic food, you will naturally increase your bone and teeth structure and also decrease the risk of developing osteoporosis. The omega-3 fat content also has a significant role in the health of your bones and teeth. You can try to consume krill oil, which is a preferred source of omega-3s.<!--more--></p>
<p>Bones adapt to exercise, so it is also important to be aware when you take calcium and vitamin D supplements. How your bones adapt to exercise can be affected by the timing of the supplements. If you are hitting the gym at least twice a week, you keep your blood levels of calcium more stable.</p>
<p><strong>The crucial role of Vitamin K2 for Bone and Teeth health<img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-2359" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/dr-marder-2-300x200.jpg" alt="SONY DSC" width="300" height="200" /></strong></p>
<p>There are a lot of issues around using calcium supplementation to ensure strong bones and healthy teeth. It is important for you to be aware of the link between calcium and other vitamins. Calcium works synergistically with vitamins D and K2. If you take calcium supplements alone, you will do more harm than good. There are dozens of minerals, and if you are focusing exclusively on calcium supplements, you will worsen the bone density. You will also increase the risk of osteoporosis. The best alternative for these supplements is unprocessed salts (like Himalayan salt). These are the best sources of a large variety of trace minerals.</p>
<p>The optimal amount of vitamin K2 the body needs is still under investigation, but the researchers think it is somewhere between 180 and 200 micrograms of vitamin K2 daily. It is estimated that 80% of Americans don’t get enough K2 Vitamin through their diet to activate their K2 proteins.</p>
<p><strong>How do you know if you lack Vitamin K2?</strong></p>
<p>There is no medical test for K2 deficiency, but you can make an idea if you need more of this critical nutrient. If you suffer from osteoporosis, diabetes or heart disease, then you are in desperate need of vitamin K2. The following foods are rich in Vitamin K2 and are good for your health.</p>
<ul>
<li>Grass-fed organic animal products (such as butter, eggs, dairy)</li>
<li>Goose liver pâté</li>
<li>Certain fermented foods like natto and vegetables fermented with the help of a starter culture of vitamin K2-generating bacteria.</li>
<li>Certain cheese such as Gouda and Brie</li>
</ul>
<p>This is a natural way of building strong bones and teeth. Giving your body the minerals needed in a natural manner helps your health and reduces the risk of osteoporosis and dental decay.</p>
