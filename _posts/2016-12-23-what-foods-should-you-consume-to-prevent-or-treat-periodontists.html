<p>As you may know, periodontitis, also referred to as gum disease, represents an inflammation of the gums that leads to major dental problems, including tooth loss. Periodontists is the most severe stage of gingivitis, where the gums recede, leaving the tooth root exposed. While Periodontitis is a serious problem that needs to be addressed immediately by your dentist, you can also do your part to help treat your gums. It is proven that certain food items have beneficial effects on the gums, helping avoid periodontitis or even ameliorate it.<!--more--></p>
<p><strong>Ginger root</strong></p>
<p>Whether you take it with your natural orange juice or use it to spice up your food, ginger will do wonders for your gums. It has anti-inflammatory properties, and it is packed with nutrients and vitamins that help you maintain perfect health.</p>
<p><strong>Apples</strong></p>
<p>Besides being healthy and delicious, apples have the great advantage of promoting a cleansing of your gums. They help destroy the plaque on your teeth, stimulate saliva flow and offer your body the necessary vitamins for optimal health.</p>
<p><strong>Milk</strong></p>
<p>Everybody knows that milk is beneficial for the body, but did you know it is also a great promoter of gum health? It contains calcium that fortifies the teeth and bones in your body, but it also contains something called protein casein. Recent studies have shown that protein casein reduces the level of acids in the mouth, helping restore your gums’ health.</p>
<p><strong>Leafy Greens</strong></p>
<p>Whether you take your greens as salad or side dish, leafy greens are always a good idea. They contain a lot of fiber, stimulating saliva flow and helping in the process of mouth cleaning. Eat spinach, celery and even cooked beans to ensure your gums’ health.</p>
<p><strong>Raw Onion</strong></p>
<p>They may not be ideal for your breath, but raw onions are great for your gums. Onions are an active bacteria-fighting food item and contain antimicrobial ingredients. According to studies, onions have the power to completely destroy four bacteria strains that are linked to gum disease. And don’t worry about bad breath. Unlike garlic, that remains in your system for a long time, and it causes bad breath that cannot be resolved with toothpaste and mouthwash, onions don’t cause long – lasting bad breath. You can just consume them, wait for 15 minutes and brush your teeth to freshen up your breath.</p>
<p>Other great foods to fight gum disease are carrots, oranges, and food items that contain antioxidants, vitamin E, and Omega – 3 fats. Besides your diet, you should make sure to follow your dentist’s instructions, brush your teeth twice a day, floss and rinse your mouth with mouthwash. Don’t forget to visit your dentist regularly to avoid suffering from other dental problems. Gum disease is a severe condition, but it is not untreatable.</p>
