<p>Dentistry is not all about teeth and gums.</p>
<p>You may not know it, but dental teams are playing major roles in maintaining whole body health. Research is proving that your health and wellness is directly connected with your oral health. Also known as the oral systemic link, poor oral care increases our chances for serious health risks. This includes:<!--more--></p>
<ul>
<li>Heart disease</li>
<li>Stroke</li>
<li>Cancer</li>
<li>Diabetes</li>
<li>Alzheimer’s</li>
<li>And much more!</li>
</ul>
<p>Routine brushing and flossing helps curb destructive bacteria from growing without restraint. Being negligent with this allows bacteria to overpower the natural defense system our gums provide. Without protective healthy tissue acting as barrier, we’re facing a bacterial jailbreak. Suspected escape routes are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Surfing the Stream:</strong> Once oral bacterium have permeated your gum tissue they are free to catch a ride through your circulatory system. Their arrival in other tissue and organ systems can trigger infections. If you have a pre-existing inclination towards cardiovascular disease, kidney disease, diabetes or other diseases with inflammatory origins, you risk aggravating them.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Aquatic-Aerial Routine:</strong> A mouth overloaded with bacteria naturally results in saliva laced with toxins. With each inhalation, you risk aspirating bacteria laden water droplets into your lungs, potentially causing pulmonary infections and pneumonia. The elderly or those suffering from weakened immune systems (associated with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) can find this especially worrisome.</li>
</ul>
<p>All these health risks can be significantly lowered if we took better care of our teeth and gums.</p>
