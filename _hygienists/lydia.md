Hi I'm Lydia! Iâ€™m from Bellingham and received my Dental Hygiene certification at Bellingham Technical College. I moved to the area in March 2020 and have been enjoying exploring the local beaches, lakes, and mountains. 

I am passionate about providing high quality care for you that suits your needs while also building strong personal relationships. I love helping you feel happier and more confident about your smile!

In my free time I enjoy doing things like hiking, crafts, paddle boarding, riding my motorcycle, and hanging out with my friends, family, and kitty, Diamond.
