Hi I’m Sarah! I moved here from Bellingham to attend Shoreline Community College's Dental Hygiene program.  I decided to stay after graduation because of my new found love for the community in my area. 

I have a son whom I enjoy taking out on adventures such as hiking, snowboarding, camping, biking, and road trips to neighboring states. 

My life’s motto: "Do not go where the path may lead, go instead where there is no path and leave a trail," - R.W. Emerson
