Hi I’m Sarah! 

I moved here from Bellingham to attend Shoreline Community College's Dental Hygiene program.  I decided to stay after graduation because of my new found love for the community in my area. I have a son whom I enjoy taking out on adventures such as hiking, snowboarding, camping, biking, and road trips to neighboring states. My life’s motto is, "Do not go where the path may lead, go instead where there is no path and leave a trail” (Emerson).

As your hygienist, I strive to make you feel at ease with maximum comfort in each experience with me, and work with you to create an individualized plan towards wellness. My hope is that you leave the office feeling well taken care of and excited to have gained a new skill or piece of information to help continue the journey towards a healthy state of being!
