Hi I’m Emily! I grew up in Oregon, and received my Bachelor’s Degree in Biology at the University of Oregon.  I moved to Washington in 2007 and attended Shoreline Community College to receive my Associate’s Degree in Dental Hygiene.  I went into dental hygiene because I, myself, have dental anxiety.  I want to help others overcome this common phobia and have a comfortable and fearless experience.  I am passionate about treating the body as a whole, educating you and working with you to reach your goals. Together we can achieve greatness!  In my free time I enjoy spending time with my husband and two sons.  We can often be found skiing down the slopes or reeling in our catch of the day on the beautiful Puget Sound!
