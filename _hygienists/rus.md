Hi I’m Rus! After being a dental assistant for several years my desire to grow in dentistry led me to Shoreline Community College where I have completed the Dental Hygiene program and joined Integrative Dentistry. It’s my desire to help you improve and maintain your oral health by providing needed periodontal services and educating you on a personal level. I really enjoy seeing patients who have dental fear, anxiety, or just want a gentle approach. 

Family is very important to me, so when I am not in the office, I like to spend quality time with my wife and daughters. I also enjoy outdoor activities such as camping, fishing, and traveling.
