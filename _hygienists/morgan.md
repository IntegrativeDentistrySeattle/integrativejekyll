Hi, I’m Morgan! I’m originally from Idaho but I moved to Oregon to attend Pacific University where I received my Bachelor’s of Science Degree in Dental Hygiene. I then moved to Seattle on a whim and am excited to explore all it has to offer! I love taking my dog to the beach, going for hikes, and trying new food places. 

While you’re with me in my chair, I promise to create an environment that feels comfortable and safe for you, being mindful of those with dental anxiety. I genuinely enjoy taking the time to get to know each of my patients, and it is always my goal that you leave feeling heard and well taken care of!
