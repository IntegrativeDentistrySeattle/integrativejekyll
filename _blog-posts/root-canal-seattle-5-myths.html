<p><em><strong>When you hear “root canal,” do you cringe?</strong></em> Root canals have received a negative stigma over the years, but that is not the case. Our techniques, technology, and anesthetics can make this common procedure comfortable and quick.</p>
<p>Let us help you put your mind at ease by debunking five root canal myths and how we can help make your visit comfortable with our <a href="http://www.mitchmarderdds.com/services/root-canal-seattle-therapy/ ">root canal therapy</a>.<!--more--></p>
<h1></h1>
<h1><strong>Myth 1: Treatment is Painful</strong></h1>
<p>There is the stigma root canal is a painful, excruciating procedure. But, <strong>the truth is root canal therapy is performed to relieve pain</strong>. Root canals are needed when an untreated cavity spreads to the pulp of your tooth and causes an infection. This is where the pain comes from, not the procedure itself.</p>
<p>Dr. Mitch Marder will numb the area around the infected tooth where you will <strong>hardly feel anything</strong> during the procedure. Once complete, the excruciating pain you’ve experience before will disappear, and your tooth will be saved.</p>
<h1><strong>Myth 2: Root Canals Cause Illness</strong></h1>
<p>This common misconception indicates root canals can lead to negative health risks such as heart disease, kidney disease, and much more. However, this is not the case. Our natural root canal therapy uses tools and techniques (<strong>bio-compatible ozone therapy, ozone gas, laser cleansing, and herbal therapies</strong>) to completely and safely disinfect the tooth.</p>
<h1><strong>Myth 3: Root Canals Are Irrelevant if You’re Not in Pain</strong></h1>
<p>Just because you are not in pain does not mean your smile is in pristine condition. <strong>Maintaining regular dental visits</strong> can help us catch the early stages of severe decay, and predict whether you need a root canal in our Seattle office.</p>
<p>Getting your root canal done early is a way to skip all the pain you would have to go through once your tooth severely becomes infected. It’s best to get regular check-ups to avoid the pain and complications from an infected tooth.</p>
<h1><strong>Myth 4: It’s a Lengthy Process</strong></h1>
<p>Many people believe root canal therapy requires many visits, but that is not the case. A follow-up may need to occur, but the procedure can be completed in one visit, depending on the case. Dr. Marder can perform root canals in a <strong>natural setting conveniently in the dental office</strong>.</p>
<h1><strong>Myth 5: It is Better to Pull the Tooth</strong></h1>
<p>There is the rumor that root canal therapy is short-term. However, modern techniques and technology has made the procedure predictable with high success rates.</p>
<p>While people prefer extractions over the root canal, it’s important to save your natural teeth. Your natural smile is the strongest and long-lasting solution to maintain a healthy life. Once your tooth is gone, it’s gone. A dental implant and bridge cannot replace the effective function a natural tooth can.</p>
<p>We will gladly <strong>educate and answer all of your questions about root canal therapy</strong>. We offer fantastic methods to save your tooth, and will go the extra mile to make   sure you are comfortable during your procedure.</p>
