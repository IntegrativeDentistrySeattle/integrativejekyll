<p>Fluoride is an inorganic anion of fluorine that wears the symbol F.  It is a toxic drug that is linked to countless potential severe health problems. Recent studies have concluded that fluoridated water consumption can result in a severe thyroid dysfunction. The studies have also linked the fluoridated water consumption with exacerbate behavior problems as ADHD, by starting a process of calcification of the pineal gland. These studies have received attention from both American and British media, but with no significant results so far. In America, more than 70 percent of all Americans are receiving water enriched artificially with fluoride by the municipal water supplies. This means that almost 211 million Americans are drinking fluoridated water and from this vast number more than 11 million are receiving water with levels of fluoride above “optimal”.<!--more--></p>
<p><strong>The Myth Of Fluoride</strong></p>
<p>The water fluoridation has been promoted over time as a safe and efficient way of improving dental health, but science has yet to prove this fact. But what science has proven is that if you expose yourself to bigger quantities of fluoride than recommended it can cause hazardous health problems. In Britain, researchers are expecting more than 15.000 people afflicted with hypothyroidism as a result of fluoridated water consumption. It has been proven that you have a 37% higher chance of suffering from hypothyroidism if you overexpose yourself by drinking water with fluoride levels above 0.3mg/l.</p>
<p>In the US, the currently recommended level of fluoride in the water is 0.7mg/l. This has caused thyroid dysfunction to be a common disease in US. More than 20 MILLION people are currently suffering from a dysfunctional thyroid in the US. In addition, other major side effects have been recently linked to water fluoridation like depression, weight gain, neurological problems, and significant fetus dysfunctions. Also, people who consume this type of water have shown a lowered IQ.</p>
<p><strong>Health Risks Cause By The Consumption Of Fluoride</strong></p>
<p>The thyroid dysfunctions can raise the risk of cardiovascular disease, osteoporosis, neurological diseases to the fetuses and infants, infertility, and many other health problems. Because of that researchers have urged the city council to stop the fluoridation of the drinking water. Studies have shown that if fluoride is taken internally it can cause more damage to the teeth, inducing a condition called dental fluorosis. Today 41% of the children between the ages of 12 and 14 are suffering from this condition.</p>
<p>The obvious fact is that scientists have reached the same conclusion. The best way of preventing cavities is not by adding fluoride to the water, but by addressing the diet. One of the principal culprit responsible for cavities worldwide is SUGAR. Even a dose of 10% over the recommended daily dose increases the risk of overweight, obesity, and tooth decay.  It is most recommended to consume traditional fruits and vegetables that are unprocessed, nuts and grass-fed meats. No sugars and processed foods. They encourage the proliferation of bacteria which can cause tooth and health decay.</p>
<p>Most people think that the high levels of fluoride in the drinking water only affects the teeth and nothing else. But in fact it is responsible for countless other dysfunctions. Fluoride is an endocrine disruptor that affects not only your thyroid gland but also your bones, blood sugar levels, pineal gland, and even your brain.</p>

<li>Hyperactivity</li>
<li>Bone cancer</li>
<li>Incised tumor and cancer rate</li>
<li>Increased lead absorption</li>
<li>Disrupted synthesis of collagen</li>
<li>Arthritis</li>
<li>Muscles disorders</li>
<li>Damaged sperm and increased infertility</li>
<li>Skeletal fluorosis and bone fractures</li>
<li>Genetic damage and cell death</li>
<li>Inhibited formation of antibodies and disruptions of the immune system</li>
<li>Inactivation of 62 enzymes and the inhibition of more than 100</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To help decrease the health problems that fluoridated water has caused it is indicated to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Eliminate sugar, genetically engineered foods, and processed foods.</li>
<li>Drink purified water and to help break up the calcification process of the pineal gland, drink one glass of water with one teaspoon of organic apple cider vinegar each day.</li>
<li>Take antioxidant supplements</li>
<li>Use non-fluoridated toothpaste</li>
<li>Eat more fruits like apple and pears that contain natural antioxidants</li>
</ul>
<p>In conclusion, Fluoride is bad for your health and has no real benefits. It is a health hazard that anyone should avoid. Fluoride is a cumulative toxin, and if you are exposed to it for an extended period it can cause serious health concerns. You should try to find a way to convince your area council to eliminate the process of fluoridation from the daily basis and consume no products that contain fluoridated substances.</p>
