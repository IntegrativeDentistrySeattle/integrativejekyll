<p>People believe that if they choose sugar-free beverages and chewing gum, they are protecting their teeth. Xylitol, the sugar alcohol, is popular in sugar-free foods. It is even believed that is can help the fight against tooth decay. For example, the European Union approved the use of this “tooth friendly” ingredient in chewing gums.</p>
<p>But if you see the words “sugar-free” on the label, you don’t have to assume that is it safe for your teeth and your body. In fact, newer studies have revealed that the foods and drinks that contain xylitol can cause serious dental problems.<!--more--></p>
<p><strong>Tooth erosion</strong></p>
<p>Sugar-free foods and drinks, don’t contain sugar, so they are less likely to contribute to the formation of carries. But they have the ability to cause different tooth problems, such as dental erosion. Even if the foods contain the cavity-fighter xylitol, all the sugar-free products have acidic flavorings and preservatives that lead to dental erosion.<img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-2381" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/dr-marder-1-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199" /></p>
<p>Unlike caries, dental erosion is a decalcification process, which over time will dissolve the tooth entirely. Every food and beverage that is acidic can contribute to tooth erosion. This includes carbonated beverages, such as sodas, sports drinks, lemon juice, fruit juice and vinegar.</p>
<p>But if you reduce or, better, eliminate the erosive products you consume, you can protect your teeth from unwanted and unnecessary damage. So if you are consuming sugar-free foods thinking you protect your teeth, you shouldn’t. In fact, you don’t necessarily have to think of a sugar-free or sugary product, you have to think about acidity levels.</p>
<p><strong>Artificial sweeteners make you fat</strong></p>
<p>Tooth erosion is just one of the problems. For example, artificial sweeteners are toxic. Aspartame (which can be found in Equal, Equal Measure, Spoonful, AminoSweet, Benevia, Canderel, NutraTaste, and others) is metabolized by your body in wood alcohol (poison) and formaldehyde. Formaldehyde embalms the tissue and is impossible to eliminate from your body through normal waste filterings like the liver and kidneys. It is also linked to cancer, brain tumors, birth defects, and weight gain.</p>
<p>Another compound that was approved by the ADA is Sucralose or Splenda. The approval was based on two human studies that lasted less than four days and against the animal studies which found that this sweetener decreases the number of the red blood cells, and contributes to enlarged kidneys, male infertility, spontaneous abortions and increased death rate.</p>
<p><strong>Better to choose low sugar intake than sugar-free products</strong></p>
<p>The cavities are produced by the sugars that enter your mouth and feed the bacteria.  But if you remove the surplus bacteria and acids from your mouth by drinking water and brushing twice a day, you can keep these problems away. If you choose to consume sugar-free products, you will harm your body to such an extent that it will be impossible to get better.</p>
<p>The maximum intake of sugar each day should be not more than 9 grams (3 tablespoons). But in a soda can (0.33L) you find more than three times the amount. So you should watch the levels of sugar in the products you consume and stay away from sugar-free products.</p>
<p>In addition, you can do regular dentist visits to resolve any newly appeared problems. You can ask your dentist about oral hygiene products and which are recommended for your needs.</p>
