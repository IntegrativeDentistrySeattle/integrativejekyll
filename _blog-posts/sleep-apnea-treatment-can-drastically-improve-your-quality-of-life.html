<p>Do you often wake up with a headache or feel like you just can’t get enough sleep?  Such a problem can be caused by broad scale of factors like night shifts, stress, or overload with work, but it can also due to sleep disorders like insomnia or sleep apnea.</p>
<p>A study of the US National Sleep Foundation, reveals that 40 million American adults suffer from chronic sleep disorders. Out of those, 22 million suffer from sleep apnea – a serious condition, which can lead to high blood pressure, chronic heart failure, and even stroke when left untreated.<!--more--></p>

<p><strong>What is Sleep Apnea?</strong></p>
<p>Sleep apnea is a condition where the sufferer’s airways are blocked for short periods of time while sleeping, which condition interrupts the sleep pattern.</p>
<p><strong>Sleep apnea can be of several types. </strong>Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is the most common one and is caused by obstruction of the upper airway. It is characterized by repetitive pauses in breathing during sleep, despite the effort to breathe, and is usually associated with a reduction in blood oxygen saturation. Central sleep apnea is a condition in which the airway is not blocked but the brain fails to signal the muscles to breathe. A combination of the two former described conditions is called complex sleep apnea.</p>
<p><em> </em></p>
<p><strong>What are the symptoms of sleep apnea?</strong></p>
<p>You should consider consulting a medical professional if you are experiencing any of the following symptoms:</p>
<ul>
<li>Chronic snoring</li>
<li>Early morning headaches</li>
<li>Memory problems</li>
<li>Waking up with a sore or dry throat</li>
<li>Waking up choking or gasping for air</li>
<li>Daytime sleepiness</li>
<li>Insomnia</li>
<li>Restless sleep</li>
<li>Mood changes</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em> </em></strong></p>
<p><strong>How is sleep apnea treated? </strong></p>
<p>People, suffering from sleep apnea should first consider treatment options like weight loss, avoiding alcohol and smoking, as well as physical training. Sleep apnea can also be treated with variety of surgical procedures.</p>
<p>However, the most common and successful treatment for moderate and severe sleep apnea is the usage of sleep apnea appliance.</p>
<p>Sleep apnea appliances are worn while sleeping to keep your throat and airway open. This reduces daytime sleepiness and lowers the number of times you pause or stop breathing during your sleep.</p>
<p>The variety of sleep apnea appliances, available on the market is huge and you can buy one directly online. However, you should always check with your Seattle dentist before ordering one, as such devices might need some modification to meet your individual needs.</p>
<p>Should you live or work in Seattle, WA, you can rely on the professional advice and services of Dr. Marder from Integrative Dentistry. Dr. Marder, who is one of the best dental specialist in Seattle would offer you a custom-made oral appliance to eliminate snoring and also as part of a treatment plan for sleep apnea.</p>
